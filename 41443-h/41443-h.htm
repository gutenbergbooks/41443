<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It seems proper to say at the outset that a general
study of the Spanish colonial system convinced me of the need of an
extended investigation of the audiencia, which was the central
institution in the colonies. It was, however, the circumstance of my
being situated in Manila for some years and thus having at my disposal
the original documents bearing upon the history of the audiencia which
was situated there that led me to study this particular tribunal. At
first sight it may appear that something of direct applicability to
Spanish-American conditions, which would have been gained by the study
of the Audiencia of Mexico, or Guadalajara, or Lima, has thus been
lost. Nevertheless, if it is borne in mind that the audiencia system
was common to all the Spanish colonies, and that the laws by which it
was constituted and regulated applied to the different political
divisions of America as to the Philippines, the assumption will not
seem wholly unjustified that the Audiencia of Manila may be taken as a
typical legal and political institution.</p>
<p>A large part of the time expended in collecting the materials upon
which this book is based was spent in the various depositories in
Manila. The most notable group of documents there is to be found in the
Philippines Library, and it is with pleasure that I express here my
obligations to Dr. James Alexander Robertson, the librarian; for not
only did Dr. Robertson place at my disposal all the resources of the
library, but he contributed generously from his adequate knowledge of
Philippine history and afforded continual inspiration during the course
of my labors in Manila. I am also deeply conscious of the assistance so
kindly rendered by Don Manuel Artigas, chief of the Division of
Filipiniana, and by Don Manuel Yriarte of the Philippine Archive.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e164" href="#xd21e164" name=
"xd21e164">v</a>]</span></p>
<p>In addition to research in the Philippines Library, the Philippine
Archive, and the Audiencia Records in Manila approximately three years
have been spent in the archives of Spain. The main centre of my work,
of course, has been the Archive of the Indies at Seville, where I was
given free access to all the available materials, and every facility
was extended to me by the chief of the archive, Don Pedro Torres
Lanzas, and by his obliging assistants. I am also indebted for many
courtesies to Don Miguel G&oacute;mez de Campillo of the National
Historical Archive at Madrid, and to Don Juan Montero, chief of the
archive at Simancas.</p>
<p>The object of this prefatory note would not be achieved if I failed
to express adequately my acknowledgment to my teacher and friend
Professor Frederick J. Teggart, of the University of California. His
inspiration led me to appreciate the importance of institutional
studies; his continued encouragement has helped me over the hard places
in the work; and I am conscious now of the extent to which he has
sought, by vigilant criticism, to guard me against precipitateness. I
am indebted to Professor Herbert Bolton for valuable aid and for advice
in the final presentation of the manuscript; to Dr. Charles Wilson
Hackett for a systematic revision of the Bibliography and of the
footnotes; to Professor E. C. Barker for advice and assistance; to
Professor W. R. Shepherd and Professor Francis S. Philbrick for their
criticism of portions of this book; and to Messrs. A. H. Allen and
Morse A. Cartwright of the University of California Press for their
many manifestations of courtesy and patience in the supervision of its
publication. To Professor H. Morse Stephens of the University of
California and to the generous order of the Native Sons of the Golden
West I am indebted for the rare opportunity of two years of foreign
residence and research in the various archives of Spain.</p>
<p>Finally, my greatest indebtedness is to my wife, who has
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e171" href="#xd21e171" name=
"xd21e171">vi</a>]</span>cheerfully given up the pleasures and
conveniences of life among friends in home surroundings to accompany me
to less pleasant places, in order that I might succeed in the work
which I have undertaken.</p>

<h2 class="main">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The audiencia was primarily a judicial tribunal. It
has been considered almost entirely as such by these modern historical
writers who have referred to it in passing. Its legislative,
administrative, executive, and ecclesiastical functions have received
little attention. This may be owing to the fact that little or no
documentary study of the audiencia has heretofore been made. A great
deal of attention has been devoted in this book to the non-judicial
functions of the audiencia. A chapter has been given, indeed, to its
purely judicial activities, but the chief purpose of this investigation
has been to show that the audiencia was more than a court of justice,
and to bring out its governmental and ecclesiastical functions.</p>
<p>This study will be confined, chronologically, to the period
extending from the time of the creation of the audiencia, at the close
of the sixteenth century, to the end of the eighteenth. This limitation
is advisable, first, because the vastness of the subject requires it,
and second, because the audiencia became more concerned with judicial
and less with administrative, political, and economic affairs through
the constitutional changes which were made at the close of the
eighteenth and at the beginning of the nineteenth centuries. The
audiencia thus loses its interest, from our present viewpoint, after
the eighteenth century. Again, it may be said that owing to the loss of
colonies by Spain in the early nineteenth century, and the general
anarchy that prevailed after 1810, a continuation of an intensive study
beyond that period would be without value because its subject-matter
would be no longer characteristic.</p>
<p>In assuming that the Audiencia of Manila was typical of all the
audiencias in the Spanish colonial system, it is not claimed that the
tribunal in the Philippines was identical in every <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>function and
detail with those of the other colonies of Spain. It is no doubt true
that local conditions brought about pronounced differences and that
each audiencia had its own local characteristics and powers, which
differed from those of the others. The subject is so vast, however, and
the research required for a comparative study of all these institutions
would be so extensive that it would occupy more than a lifetime to
complete it.</p>
<p>The main interest of this investigation does not lie in the
organization, the scope, nature, or detailed powers of the audiencia as
an institution of the Philippines, but in its larger relation to the
general field of Spanish colonial history and government. It applies to
the entire field of Spanish colonial administration. It is related to
the government of Per&uacute;, New Spain, Cuba, and other colonies
wherein there were audiencias, and where functions similar to those of
the Manila tribunal were exercised. The establishment of all these
audiencias was part of the same movement, and the act of their creation
was the product of experience gained in Spain through efforts at
centralization there. The audiencias of the colonies were alike
dependent on the Council of the Indies; common institutions and
departments of government existed in Spain for the control and
regulation of the tribunals of the colonies. All were of equal judicial
rank before the Council of the Indies, and cases appealed to the latter
from the several audiencias were treated in the same manner and
considered as having equal rank and importance. The general powers and
attributes of these audiencias were prescribed in the same code, the
<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>, and general laws and <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dulas</i> of reform were expedited from time to time and
sent to the tribunals of all the colonies. Such is the basis,
therefore, of the claim that this is in reality a study of the
audiencia as an institution, illustrated particularly by the history of
that of the Philippines.</p>
<p>A study of the audiencia of any colony is concerned with all
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>of the problems that came up in its life&mdash;with
legal, political, ecclesiastical, and social conditions. It will be
seen that the audiencia was the one tribunal which regulated, checked,
and often controlled both church and state in the colonies; it
represented the king, and its duty was to see that the royal commands
were obeyed; it was the royal audiencia. Isolated as were the officials
of the Philippines, in those distant seas, removed from any but the
most remote influence of the home government, beset on all sides by
hostile forces, and dependent on themselves alone, conditions there
present an especially favorable field wherein to note the ultimate
possibilities of the authority of the audiencia. It is the design of
this treatise to examine conditions in the Philippines under the
aspects noted, and to assign them their place in the history of Spanish
colonization. The investigation of what was, beyond doubt, the most
important and many-sided institution in the Spanish administration of
the Philippines provides a means of approach to that larger field of
study.</p>
<p>A survey of the Spanish colonial system or a study of the government
of any one colony will reveal the fact that political life and power
there were vested chiefly in three institutions. Upon these the peace,
prosperity and security of each colony largely depended. These
institutions were the audiencia, the office of viceroy, or
captain-general, and the church. By means of the two former the royal
interests in the colony were represented, and through the latter one of
the chief aims of Spain&rsquo;s colonial system was effected, namely,
the conversion of infidels and the subsequent care of their souls. The
church added to its own power in various ways. No study of Spanish
colonial institutions would be complete which failed to consider the
church as a political power. It is to a consideration of these three
chief factors of colonial government, and their interrelation, that
this study will be dedicated. After a review of the circumstances
surrounding the establishment of the Audiencia of Manila, we
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>shall devote ourselves to a detailed study of the
audiencia itself. We shall first notice the audiencia&rsquo;s judicial
functions as a court of ordinary justice and secondarily as a court of
<i lang="es">residencia</i>. The second part of this section will be
concerned with the semi-judicial and administrative functions of the
audiencia.</p>
<p>The title of captain-general was primarily of military significance,
and it was exercised alike by viceroys and governors; the official
designation of the former being &ldquo;my viceroy and
captain-general&rdquo; and that of the latter being &ldquo;my governor
and captain-general.&rdquo; Not all governors were
captains-general.</p>
<p>The viceroys in the larger divisions and the captains-general in the
smaller ones represented the king as head of the church and state in
their several districts. Because these officials were so powerful and
their duties so multitudinous, they came into contact with every
department of the government. The audiencias came into relation with
these officials most frequently. It is therefore necessary to study the
governor and captain-general first from the viewpoint of his position
as chief executive of the colony and as representative of the king. The
frequency of their relations and the identity of their spheres of
authority suggest that we give attention to the conflicts of
jurisdiction of the governor and audiencia; finally, we shall take note
of the occasions on which the audiencia assumed the government on the
event of a vacancy, noticing the laws authorizing such action and the
principles underlying them.</p>
<p>The importance of the church in the Spanish colonial system has
already been alluded to. The extent of its power and the frequency and
importance of its relations with the audiencia demand considerable
attention. After studying the general phases of the relations of the
audiencia and the church, we shall see that the tribunal exercised
ecclesiastical authority of a very pronounced character. This power it
derived from two sources: first, from the authority that was entrusted
to it by virtue of the royal patronage; second, from its status as a
court of justice <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>with jurisdiction in ecclesiastical affairs similar
to that which it had as an ordinary tribunal of justice. The above is
an outline of the plan of this book.</p>
<p>That which impresses the modern student most with regard to Spanish
administrative machinery was its failure to effect deliberately the
division of powers which, with our traditions, we consider essential to
a well-balanced government. The terms &ldquo;executive&rdquo; and
&ldquo;judicial&rdquo; are employed in this book, as they were in
Spain&rsquo;s colonies, to designate functions rather than departments.
The viceroy, as president of the audiencia, had cognizance of certain
judicial matters, and more or less participation in them, though he was
forbidden to act as judge, especially over affairs in which he had
already officiated as executive. The audiencia likewise shared many
executive functions, yet it was not judge of its own acts, for when
judgment was passed on the administrative acts or judicial
pronouncements of an <i lang="es">oidor</i>, either on appeal or by
review of sentence, that magistrate was expected to retire, or to be
occupied with some other case. So, while there was no judicial
department with solely judicial functions, or a legislative or
executive department, as they are known in some modern states, there
existed certain interrelations which did not entirely result in
confusion, as one might suppose. On the contrary, it may be often noted
that as a resultant of this system, men and acts of an exceedingly
well-balanced and statesmanlike character were produced. We shall see,
moreover, that they were far from meriting the disapprobation that is
frequently heaped upon so-called Spanish governmental incapacity.</p>
<p>The defects which appear so conspicuous in Spanish administration
were largely due to the extremely methodical turn of the Spanish
official mind, the vastness of the empire which was to be governed, and
the lack of facilities available for efficient administration. It was a
government of <i lang="es">expedientes</i>, literally a government on
paper. All acts, estimates, budgets, and plans had to be drafted and
written out, duplicates and triplicates of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>each report
had to be made, advice had to be taken, and opinions rendered, whether
the matter went any further than the theoretical stage or not. We do
much the same in our modern age, but inventions and labor-saving
devices have fortunately spared us much of the time and effort which a
few centuries ago had to be expended to accomplish proportionate
results. The apparent unwieldiness of the Spanish colonial empire would
have been materially reduced by the use of the telegraph, cable,
steamship, typewriter and carbon-paper.</p>
<p>An effort has been made that this should be something more than a
theoretical dissertation. A knowledge that certain laws were
promulgated is only half of what is necessary in a study of this
character. It is imperative to understand how these laws were applied,
and whether they were efficiently and effectively carried out. Every
phase of the audiencia&rsquo;s history has, therefore, been illustrated
wherever possible with one or more concrete cases, taken from actual
practice. Many of these illustrations are comparatively insignificant
by themselves, involving persons of no historical importance and
concerning matters of a seemingly trivial nature. Nevertheless, it has
been necessary to consider these matters carefully because they were
typical and true to actual conditions, and because they reveal better
than anything else could the affairs which were the concern of the
audiencia, showing the part played by the tribunal in the life of the
colony.</p>
<p>In the preparation of this work due deference has been paid to the
standard authorities usually cited by writers of Spanish-American
history. So little attention has been given by students of Spanish
colonial history to the audiencia as an institution, however, that the
present writer has been obliged to depend almost entirely on the
hitherto untouched documentary material in Spain and the Philippines,
and to place almost his sole reliance upon it. This material consists
of laws, <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i>, royal orders, ordinances,
correspondence, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7"
name="pb7">7</a>]</span>lastly, but most important, records of cases
and actual happenings in the form of letters, memorials, reports,
complaints and contemporary accounts. These latter convey, as nothing
else can, an idea of how the laws were carried out, what was their
effect, what part the audiencia played in the interpretation and
execution of the law, and the relations of the tribunal to the other
authorities and institutions of government. Of this sort of material
there is much, and in its light the history of the Spanish colonies and
of their institutions yet remains to be written. <span class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER I</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE AUDIENCIAS OF THE SPANISH COLONIES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Spanish system of colonial administration was an
adaptation beyond the seas of fundamental administrative, judicial and
ecclesiastical institutions and principles which had grown up and had
proved serviceable throughout a long period of successful use in Spain.
As the audiencias and their allied officials had shown themselves to be
efficient as agencies of centralization in the isolated provinces of
Spain, so they were utilized, by the organization which they effected,
to bring the colonies nearer the mother country. When Spain was
confronted with the necessity of governing her vast empire, it was
natural that she should profit by her former administrative experience,
and make use of those institutions of government which had proved
successful at home.</p>
<p>The purpose of the present chapter is to emphasize the fact that,
these institutions which had served in Spain, and were still in process
of development there, were utilized in all of the colonies. The
Philippine audiencia, which will be more particularly studied in
subsequent chapters, was not a rare and isolated exception, but rather
an integral part of a great administrative system.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e406src" href="#xd21e406" name="xd21e406src">1</a> This will
more clearly appear from a sketch of the early development of colonial
administration.</p>
<p>In accordance with the terms of the concession made by the Catholic
Monarchs at Santa F&eacute; on April 30, 1492, Columbus was given the
title of &ldquo;Admiral, Viceroy, and Governor of the Undiscovered
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>Lands and Seas of the Indies.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e418src" href="#xd21e418" name="xd21e418src">2</a> He
was likewise entrusted with the duty of proposing three candidates for
the government of each colony, and from these three names the king was
to select one. It was further provided that the <i lang=
"es">alcaldes</i> and <i lang="es">alguaciles</i> for the
administration of justice should be named by Columbus, and that he
should hear appeals from these minor judges in second instance. This is
a brief outline of the first government and judiciary provided for the
New World. It is improbable that this arrangement was the product of
any great amount of study or reflection. It was formulated before the
New World had even been discovered, and this scheme, as well as the
conditions of commerce and tribute which went with it, were largely
proposed by Columbus, and acceded to by the Catholic Monarchs without
anticipation of the tremendous consequences which were to come from
that voyage of discovery and those which were to follow it.</p>
<p>When Columbus undertook his second and later voyages the Catholic
rulers began to modify the conditions of the original compact by
sending royal representatives with him to take account of his
expeditions. The difficulties which Columbus had in the government of
his West Indian colony are too well known to be more than referred to
here. Through the influence of Fonseca, and the gradual realization of
the tremendous size and importance of the new dominions, the rulers of
Spain began to feel that a mistake had been made in granting to this
Genoese sailor and to his heirs the complete proprietorship and
government <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>of this distant empire. The abrogation of the
contract was a natural consequence. It was the repudiation of a
colonial system which had been created in the dark, and formulated
without a knowledge of the conditions and problems to be met. Such an
arrangement was foredoomed to failure, and if the colonies were to be
administered successfully, reform was necessary.</p>
<p>In 1507, the towns of Espa&ntilde;ola petitioned the king for the
same privileges and forms of government as were possessed by the towns
of Spain. The request was granted, and municipal rights were bestowed
upon fourteen towns. These concessions included the privilege of
electing their own <i lang="es">regidores</i> and <i lang="es">alcaldes
ordinarios</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e447src" href="#xd21e447"
name="xd21e447src">3</a> and the rights of local legislation and
administration of justice. The principle was subsequently enunciated
that,</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">inasmuch as the kingdoms of Castile and of the Indies
are under one crown, the laws and the order of government of one should
be as similar to and as much in agreement with the other as possible;
our royal council, in the laws and establishments which are ordered,
must strive to reduce the form and manner of their government to the
style and order by which the kingdoms of Castile and Le&oacute;n are
governed and ruled, to the extent that the diversity and difference of
the lands and nations permit.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e509src" href=
"#xd21e509" name="xd21e509src">4</a></p>
</div>
<p>In 1511, a tribunal of independent royal judges was constituted in
the colony of Espa&ntilde;ola to try cases appealed from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>the town
magistrates and the governor.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e524src" href=
"#xd21e524" name="xd21e524src">5</a> This judicial body may be
considered as the predecessor of the royal audiencia which was
established fifteen years later. The organization and purpose of the
tribunal were exactly similar to those of the courts existing in the
frontier provinces of Spain before the establishment of audiencias. The
chief reason for its creation was the need of checking the abuses of an
absolute governor. This tribunal was composed of three magistrates, who
were possessed of the licentiate&rsquo;s degree, designated as <i lang=
"es">alcaldes mayores</i>, and appointed by the king. They were
empowered to hear and determine appeals from the governor and from his
<i lang="es">tenientes</i> and <i lang="es">alcaldes</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e540src" href="#xd21e540" name="xd21e540src">6</a>
These magistrates, acting collectively, became at once official organs
for the expression of the needs of the colony in non-judicial matters,
frequently presenting memorials to the Council of the Indies
independently of the governor.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e565src" href=
"#xd21e565" name="xd21e565src">7</a> The crown had already assumed
direction of the administrative and executive affairs of the colony of
Puerto Rico, on August 15, 1509, by naming a special governor for that
island. On July 25, 1511, Diego Col&oacute;n, son of the discoverer,
was named governor of Espa&ntilde;ola, and of the other islands and of
the mainland discovered by his father. This <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>latter
act of royal intervention did not confirm, but rather abrogated in
practice, the claims of this same Col&oacute;n to the inheritance of
the provinces which had been given formerly to his father. This act
maintained the pre-eminence and authority of the Spanish monarchs in
these territories.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e573src" href="#xd21e573"
name="xd21e573src">8</a> The further growth and development of the West
Indian colonies, and especially the increasing Spanish population,
called for the establishment of a more efficient tribunal of
administration and justice. This need was met in the creation of the
first audiencia in America, that of Santo Domingo, which was
established September 14, 1526.</p>
<p>The law, which has been cited already, providing that the
administration of the Indies should be patterned in all ways after the
governments of Castile and Le&oacute;n, shows very clearly the natural
influence of the early history and institutions of Spain. The
audiencias established in the colonies were at first similar in
jurisdiction and organization to those of Spain, which country had
already succeeded in governing provinces that were, in effect, almost
as isolated and as far from actual contact with the court as were the
Indies. The audiencia of Spain had proved of immense value as an agency
of direct control. It had been found satisfactory under conditions very
similar to those in the Indies, which were not regarded as foreign
possessions, but as integral parts of Castile, being the property of
the monarchs of that kingdom, and under their personal direction.</p>
<p>Before proceeding with a description of the growth of the audiencia
system, it is desirable, first, to note the establishment in Spain of
two organs for the administration of colonial affairs. These may be
examined here conveniently, because their creation antedated the
institution of the audiencia in the colonies. The first,
chronologically, as well as in importance, was the <i lang="es">Casa de
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>Contrataci&oacute;n</i>, which was created January
10, 1503.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e588src" href="#xd21e588" name=
"xd21e588src">9</a> This essentially commercial body was intended at
first to supervise the import and export trade of Spain with the
colonies, and to arrange for the sale and distribution of imported
articles, concessions of cargo to individuals, the lading and
discharging of cargo, and the collection of duties. The functions of
this body were soon amplified to the extent that it was given
jurisdiction over emigration to the colonies. In 1509 it was granted
further authority over certain criminal cases relating to trade, and in
1510, <i lang="es">letrados</i> were added to the tribunal of the
<i lang="es">Casa</i> for the better determination of legal
affairs.</p>
<p>As established in 1503, the <i lang="es">Casa de
Contrataci&oacute;n</i> consisted of a treasurer, auditor
(comptroller), and factor.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e611src" href=
"#xd21e611" name="xd21e611src">10</a> That the institution flourished
and increased in importance may be deduced from the reform of Philip
II, on September 25, 1583, whereby the above mentioned officials were
retained and a royal audiencia was created within the <i lang=
"es">Casa</i>. This was composed of three <i lang="es">jueces
letrados</i> and a <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, besides the numerous
subordinate officials who usually accompanied the judicial
tribunal.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e633src" href="#xd21e633" name=
"xd21e633src">11</a> Though at first it exercised some of the functions
which belonged later to the Council of the Indies, it came subsequently
to be subordinate to that body.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e638src"
href="#xd21e638" name="xd21e638src">12</a> It was transferred to
C&aacute;diz in 1717, and was suppressed by the royal decree of June
18, 1790.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e657src" href="#xd21e657" name=
"xd21e657src">13</a> its remaining attributions being assumed by the
<i lang="es">Consulado</i> of Seville.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e677src" href="#xd21e677" name="xd21e677src">14</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>The beginnings of the Council of the Indies may be noted in the
creation of a special committee of the Council of Castile for the
supervision of administrative affairs in the colonies. This was eight
years after the establishment of the <i lang="es">Casa de
Contrataci&oacute;n</i>, when another need than the purely commercial,
for which the <i lang="es">Casa de Contrataci&oacute;n</i> had served,
began to be felt.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e693src" href="#xd21e693"
name="xd21e693src">15</a> The inadequacy of the system devised by the
Catholic Monarchs at Santa F&eacute; had already become evident. The
problems of administration in the colonies were making clear the need
of a more effective system of regulation. Just as the number of suits
to be tried before the old <i lang="es">tribunal de la cort del rey</i>
had increased to such an extent that the king could no longer attend to
them personally, so the problems of administration in the new colonies
demanded more attention and regulation than could be provided by the
administrative machinery at hand. The functions of this new tribunal,
if it may be designated as such at this time, do not seem to have been
clearly expressed at first, at least by any law or decree now at hand,
but it appears that they were advisory rather than administrative. It
soon became evident that a distinction had to be made between the
prerogatives of this council and those of the <i lang="es">Casa de
Contrataci&oacute;n</i>. During the early history of these two
tribunals there was considerable conflict of jurisdiction between them.
It is probable that until the reform of August 4, 1524, was
promulgated, active supervision of colonial affairs was maintained by
the Council of Castile, both the <i lang="es">Casa de
Contrataci&oacute;n</i> and this new tribunal of the Indies acting
under its direction. Charles V gave new life to the tribunal of the
Indies on the above date by assigning to it definite legislative and
administrative powers, putting at its head Loaysa, the general of the
Dominican order and his own confessor. The Council was further modified
by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>Charles V in 1542, and by Philip II in 1571, in
the following terms:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">It is our royal will that the said council shall have
the supreme jurisdiction in all our occidental Indies ... and of the
affairs which result from them, ... and for the good government and
administration of justice, it may order and make with our advice, the
laws, pragmatics, ordinances and provisions, general and <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e720" title="Source: particlular">particular</span>, ...
which ... may be required for the good of the provinces ... and in the
matters pertaining to the Indies, that the said our council be obeyed
and respected, and that its provisions in all, and by all be fulfilled
and obeyed in all particulars.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e723src" href=
"#xd21e723" name="xd21e723src">16</a></p>
</div>
<p>The Council of the Indies, as established in 1524, consisted of a
president, a high chancellor, eight members who were lawyers, a
<i lang="es">fiscal</i>, two secretaries and a lieutenant
chancellor.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e733src" href="#xd21e733" name=
"xd21e733src">17</a> All these were required to be of noble birth and
qualified by experience and ability to carry to a successful issue the
high responsibilities which they were called upon to
discharge.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e764src" href="#xd21e764" name=
"xd21e764src">18</a> Besides there was a corps of accountants,
auditors, copyists, reporters and clerks. The number of these
last-mentioned functionaries was enormous, especially in subsequent
years, when correspondence with twelve or thirteen different colonies
was maintained.</p>
<p>The Council of the Indies was the high court of appeal to which all
cases from the colonial audiencias came for final adjudication. It was,
however, not only a court of appeal in judicial <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>matters,
but also a directive ministry for the supervision of the administrative
acts of the colonial audiencias and executives.</p>
<p>The unqualified success of the Audiencia of Santo Domingo, both as a
tribunal of justice and as an administrative organ, led to the general
establishment of the institution throughout the Spanish colonial
empire. The audiencias which were created in Spain&rsquo;s colonies
from 1526 to 1893 follow in the order of their establishment.<a class=

</div>
<p>It will be noted that the audiencias of Mexico and Lima contained
the greatest number of magistrates. They were divided into two <i lang=
"es">salas</i>, a civil and a criminal, with appropriate judges and
<i lang="es">fiscales</i> for each.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1107src"
href="#xd21e1107" name="xd21e1107src">23</a> The judges of the criminal
branch were designated as <i lang="es">alcaldes</i> and not as <i lang=
"es">oidores</i>. These audiencias were at first conterminous in
territorial jurisdiction with the respective captaincies-general of
those names, but they enjoyed no greater power or pre-eminence before
the Council of the Indies than the audiencias of the lesser
captaincies-general. In the words of the royal decree of
establishment,</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">there are founded twelve royal audiencias and
chanceries ... in order that our vassals may have persons to rule and
govern them in peace and justice, and their districts have been divided
into governments, <i lang="es">corregimientos</i> and <i lang=
"es"><span class="corr" id="xd21e1143" title=
"Source: alcald&iacute;as">alcaldes</span> mayores</i> who will be

Council.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1147src" href="#xd21e1147" name=
"xd21e1147src">24</a></p>
</div>
<p>Many changes were made in the territorial jurisdiction of the
various audiencias. The audiencias of Lima and Mexico, in addition to
their jurisdiction over their respective viceroyalties, exercised
governmental authority over the adjacent districts when the viceroys
were absent; the Audiencia of Lima over Charcas, Quito and Tierra Firme
(Panam&aacute;), and that of Mexico over what was later Guadalajara,
the Philippines, and Yucat&aacute;n. All of these, except the latter,
came to have audiencias, with the usual powers and authority.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1154src" href="#xd21e1154" name=
"xd21e1154src">25</a></p>
<p>The first seven audiencias were founded by Charles V. Three
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>were created by Philip II. The audiencias of
Santiago de Chile and Buenos Ayres were established by Philip III and
Philip IV, respectively. The greater number of these audiencias was
created at the time of the most rapid extension of the tribunals in
Spain; their establishment was part of the same general tendency; they
were therefore closely related. When the audiencias of Santo Domingo
and Mexico were formed, there had been already in existence in Spain
the chanceries of Valladolid, and Granada. Thirteen audiencias were
established in Spain after those of Santo Domingo and New Spain were
created in the colonies. The two Spanish audiencias mentioned above
were designated as models for the tribunals of the Indies, and the
principle was laid down that if a necessary provision was omitted from
the laws of establishment of the colonial audiencias, &ldquo;all the
presidents and audiencias of those our realms are ordered to preserve
the order and practices which are followed in the chanceries of Granada
and Valladolid.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1172src" href=
"#xd21e1172" name="xd21e1172src">26</a></p>
<p>Territorially, the audiencias of Santo Domingo, Mexico, and Lima
were the nucleii from which and around which most of the other
audiencias were established. Being the first in their respective
sections, they included more territory than they could govern with
facility; thus it later became necessary to divide up their districts.
Santo Domingo held sway at first over Espa&ntilde;ola, Cuba, and Puerto
Rico, with authority also over Venezuela and subsequently over
Louisiana and Florida.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1179src" href=
"#xd21e1179" name="xd21e1179src">27</a> New Granada <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>was
conceded an audiencia in 1549, and to this province were added the
possessions of Panam&aacute; when the audiencia of that name
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1201" title="Source: were">was</span>
suppressed. The Audiencia of Mexico, created eight years before New
Spain was made a viceroyalty, had territorial jurisdiction at first
over a vast empire, which was later divided into smaller governments
with audiencias. Its limits, as defined in the laws of the Indies,
extended on both oceans from the Cape of Florida to the Cape of
Honduras, and included Yucat&aacute;n, and Tabasco.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1204src" href="#xd21e1204" name="xd21e1204src">28</a></p>
<p>The audiencias of Guadalajara, Santiago de Guatemala, and Manila all
set definite limits to the jurisdiction of the Audiencia of Mexico. The
Audiencia of Lima had authority at first over most of Spanish South
America, but its scope was in the same manner diminished from time to
time by the establishment of the audiencias of Santa F&eacute;, La
Plata (Charcas), Quito, Santiago de Chile, and Buenos Ayres. Before the
Audiencia of Cuzco was instituted in 1787, jurisdiction over that
ancient city and district was divided between the audiencias of Lima
and La Plata; &Aacute;rica, although it belonged to the district of
Lima, was not governed under that jurisdiction, but was administered by
a <i lang="es">corregidor</i> directly responsible to the audiencia at
Charcas.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1220src" href="#xd21e1220" name=
"xd21e1220src">29</a> Chile and Panam&aacute; were subordinate
governmentally to the viceroy of Per&uacute;, but the audiencias were
independent.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1225src" href="#xd21e1225"
name="xd21e1225src">30</a></p>
<p>Cuba was early divided into two districts under the rule of
captains-general, those of Havana and Santiago de Cuba.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1232src" href="#xd21e1232" name=
"xd21e1232src">31</a> By <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of February 24,
1784, Havana was made independent of the Audiencia of Santo Domingo in
administrative matters. Aside from the one at Puerto Pr&iacute;ncipe,
audiencias were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>not created in Cuba, however, until 1835 and 1838,
respectively. Prior to this, Cuba was subject to the Audiencia of
Puerto Pr&iacute;ncipe, the successor of Santo Domingo, in judicial
matters, as the governments in Cuba were military. However, military
cases were carried before the captains-general of Havana and of
Santiago de Cuba, respectively.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1242src"
href="#xd21e1242" name="xd21e1242src">32</a></p>
<p>Although all the audiencias had the same rank before the Council of
the Indies, both as political and judicial tribunals, those of Lima and
Mexico may be said to have been tribunals of the first class, for
reasons which we have noted. Indeed, it must be remembered that it was
the individual captaincy-general that had an audiencia, whether the
captaincy-general happened to be a viceroyalty or not. Judged by the
amount of power they exercised, there were three classes of audiencias:
those of the viceroyalties, of the captaincies-general, and of the
presidencies. On this basis of classification, it may be said that the
first-mentioned were the superior institutions. In matters of military
administration, the captains-general had the same power as the
viceroys, while the audiencias exercised less intervention in the
government than in the presidencies. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>In the latter, the
audiencias (and presidents) exercised governmental functions as well as
judicial, with appeal to the viceroy. Though they had no military
power, and their scope was strictly limited in financial affairs, these
audiencias actually governed their districts. This the audiencias of
the viceroyalties never did, except when they governed <i lang="la">ad
interim</i>.</p>
<p>Before proceeding with a study of the powers and duties of the
colonial audiencias, it would be well to compare them, as to extent of
jurisdiction and authority, with those which were in operation in
Spain. Were they equal? Did the colonial institutions, on account of
their isolation, exercise prerogatives which were unknown to the
tribunals of the Peninsula, or vice versa? These questions were
answered by Juan de Sol&oacute;rzano y Pereyra, a distinguished Spanish
jurist, <i lang="es">oidor</i> of the Audiencia of Lima in 1610, and
subsequently councillor of the Indies.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1465src" href="#xd21e1465" name="xd21e1465src">33</a>
Sol&oacute;rzano y Pereyra illustrates fourteen points of difference
wherein the audiencias of the colonies exceeded those of the Peninsula
in power and authority, in these matters exercising jurisdiction equal
to the Council of Castile. This, he said, was &ldquo;on account of the
great distance intervening between them and the king or his royal
Council of the Indies, and the dangers which delay may occasion.&rdquo;
Therefore, he said, the audiencias had <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>been permitted many
privileges and powers denied to the audiencias of Spain. The most
important of these powers were as follows: jurisdiction over <i lang=
"es">residencias</i> of <i lang="es">corregidores</i>; the right to
send out special investigators (<i lang="es">pesquisidores</i>);
supervision over inferior judges&mdash;seeing that they properly tried
cases under their authority, care for the education and good treatment
of the Indians in spiritual and temporal matters, and the punishment of
officials who were remiss in that particular; the collection of tithes;
the assumption of the rights and obligations of the royal patronage, as
well as jurisdiction over cases affecting the same, the building of
churches, the installment of curates and holders of benefices, and the
inspection and possible retention of bulls and briefs.</p>
<p>The colonial audiencias were instructed to guard the royal
prerogative, and were authorized to try all persons accused of usurping
the royal jurisdiction. They were to see that officials, lay and
ecclesiastical, did not charge excessive fees for their services,
limiting especially those exorbitant charges which priests were apt to
demand at burials, funerals, marriages and baptisms. The colonial
audiencias were given supervision over <i lang=
"es">espolios</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1500src" href=
"#xd21e1500" name="xd21e1500src">34</a> collecting, administering and
disposing of the properties left by deceased prelates, and paying
claims of heirs and creditors. Another duty was the restraining of
ecclesiastical judges and dignitaries through the <i lang="es">recurso
de fuerza</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1506src" href="#xd21e1506"
name="xd21e1506src">35</a> This authority had been permitted to the
chanceries of Valladolid and Granada, only.</p>
<p>Although viceroys and governors were granted special jurisdiction
over administrative matters, they were authorized to call upon the
<i lang="es">acuerdos</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1515src" href=
"#xd21e1515" name="xd21e1515src">36</a> of the audiencias for counsel
and advice whenever an exceptionally arduous case presented itself. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>audiencias were permitted to entertain appeals
against the rulings of viceroys and presidents, but these appeals could
be carried again to the Council of the Indies. In the same manner that
affairs of government belonged to the private jurisdiction of the
executive, so did financial matters, according to Sol&oacute;rzano y
Pereyra. In these, however, the viceroy or governor was assisted in the
solution of perplexing problems by the <i lang="es">acuerdo general de
hacienda</i>, a body composed of <i lang="es">oidores</i>, <i lang=
"es">oficiales reales</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1532src" href=
"#xd21e1532" name="xd21e1532src">37</a> and <i lang=
"es">contadores</i>. On the death, disability, or absence of the
viceroy or governor and captain-general it was ordered that the
government should pass under the charge of the entire audiencia.
Lastly, Sol&oacute;rzano y Pereyra pointed out that while the sole duty
of the Spanish <i lang="es">oidores</i> was to try cases, the
magistrates of the colonial audiencias were called upon for a number of
miscellaneous functions, such as those of <i lang="es">visitador</i>,
or inspector of the provinces, or of other departments of the
government, as <i lang="es">asesor</i> of the Santa Cruzada,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1607src" href="#xd21e1607" name=
"xd21e1607src">38</a> as inspector of ships, as <i lang="es">auditor de
guerra</i>, as <i lang="es">asesor</i> of the governor, and as <i lang=
"es">juez de las executor&iacute;as</i>, under commission of the
Council of the Indies to collect and remit to the government receiver
all money <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>derived from fines and penalties imposed by
official visitors (<i lang="es">visitadores</i>), judges of <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>, <i>etcetera</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1653src" href="#xd21e1653" name="xd21e1653src">39</a></p>
<p>With the exception of the entertainment of the <i lang="es">recurso
de fuerza</i>, none of the above-mentioned functions could be exercised
by the audiencias of Spain. Although the colonial audiencias were to a
large extent patterned after those of Spain, they had greater power and
exercised more extensive functions almost from the beginning. This was
chiefly owing to the added responsibilities of government resulting
from the isolation of the colonies and their distance from the home
government. The audiencias in Spain remained almost purely judicial.
There was no need or opportunity for them to encroach upon the
executive, or to usurp its functions, because of the control exercised
by its immediate representatives. In the colonies the audiencias were
themselves established as the agents of the royal authority, with the
special duty of limiting the abuses of the officials of the crown. In
this capacity, aside from their customary duties, the tribunals
exercised far-reaching authority of a non-judicial character.</p>
<p>It is desirable to point out in this connection that all the
colonial audiencias utilized the same law in common. <i lang=
"es">C&eacute;dulas</i>, edicts, and decrees were issued to them from a
common source, to be executed under similar circumstances, or on
particular occasions when local conditions demanded such action. The
great code of 1680, the <i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n de leyes de
los Reinos de las Indias</i>, has already been described as containing
laws, both general and particular, for the regulation of the colonial
audiencias.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1672src" href="#xd21e1672" name=
"xd21e1672src">40</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26"
name="pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the foregoing paragraphs attention has been directed briefly to
the relations of the audiencias and executives with each other, and
with the central government. Some notice at least should be given to
the means by which the will of the executive and judiciary was enforced
and executed upon and in the local units, the provinces and towns. We
have already seen that the offices of the <i lang=
"es">corregidores</i>, <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> and the
<i lang="es">alcaldes ordinarios</i> developed in Spain, the first with
jurisdiction over the larger districts, the <i lang="es">alcaldes
mayores</i> over the smaller areas and large towns, and the <i lang=
"es">alcaldes ordinarios</i> in the municipalities. In a general sense,
this system was carried into the colonies; the <i lang=
"es">corregidores</i> and <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> were in
charge of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>large provinces and districts, the <i lang=
"es">alcaldes ordinarios</i> were the judges of the Spanish towns.</p>
<p>Much the same intercourse and relations existed between these
officials in the colonies as had been characteristic of the similar
ones of Spain. But there were some differences: while in Spain the
<i lang="es">alcaldes</i> were in most cases city judges, subject to
the <i lang="es">corregidores</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1792src"
href="#xd21e1792" name="xd21e1792src">41</a> in the colonies there was
little or no difference between <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> and
<i lang="es">corregidores</i>. They were most frequently appointed by
the executive, sometimes independently, sometimes by the assistance and
advice of the audiencia, as judges and governors of the provinces,
although the laws of the Indies provided for their appointment by the
king. The practice developed of designating them locally, and of
sending their names to Spain for confirmation. Each <i lang=
"es">alcalde mayor</i> or <i lang="es">corregidor</i> resided at the
chief town of his province and combined in himself the functions of
judge, inspector of <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>, administrator of
<i lang="es">hacienda</i> and police, collector of tribute, vicepatron
and captain-general.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1817src" href=
"#xd21e1817" name="xd21e1817src">42</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>He was assisted by
officials of a minor category, frequently natives, who exercised
jurisdiction over their fellows. The law also provided for a <i lang=
"es">teniente letrado</i> to assist the <i lang="es">alcalde</i> or
<i lang="es">corregidor</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1834src" href=
"#xd21e1834" name="xd21e1834src">43</a> but in the Philippines there
was no such official, except at irregular intervals in the Visayas.</p>
<p>These chiefs of provinces were responsible to the audiencias in
matters of justice and to the viceroys or captains-general in
administrative affairs. In Indian relations and in questions involving
<i lang="es">encomiendas</i> they were subject to the executive, who
had jurisdiction in first instance, with appeal to the audiencia. The
tribunal could grant <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> in default of the
regularly appointed executive. In financial matters the <i lang=
"es">corregidores</i> and <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> were
responsible to the executive, but they acted as the agents of the
treasury officials (<i lang="es">oficiales reales</i>) in the
collection of the revenue. In their provinces they supervised the
building of ships, the construction of roads and bridges, the <i lang=
"es">repartimientos</i> or <i lang="es">polos</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1868src" href="#xd21e1868" name="xd21e1868src">44</a> of Indians,
and the planting of tobacco when the tobacco monopoly existed in the
Philippines. In these matters they were responsible to the governor,
viceroy, or superintendent, and to the various <i lang="es">juntas
reales</i> and committees, of which at least one <i lang="es">oidor</i>
was always a member.</p>
<p>Tributes from the Indians, tithes from the <i lang=
"es">encomenderos</i> and other kinds of local taxes were collected by
the <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> and <i lang=
"es">corregidores</i>. Acting for the vicepatron, these officials
represented the subdelegated authority of the king over the monasteries
and churches of their provinces. They officiated at the formal bestowal
of benefices, they were expected to maintain <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>harmonious relations with the priests and friars
in their provinces, and to check, by their personal presence and
intervention, if necessary, any tendency on the part of the churchmen
to abuse the Indians or to impose upon them.</p>
<p>In like manner they were supposed to prevent the ecclesiastical
judges from exceeding their power, and particularly from transgressing
the royal jurisdiction, which frequently occurred in the earlier years
when that authority had not become clearly defined or firmly
established. As the churchmen with whom these officials had to deal
derived their authority from the higher prelates and the provincials of
the orders and often acted by their direction, their opposition to the
local officials of the civil government was frequently so effective
that the latter were obliged to appeal to the audiencia. The latter
tribunal had the power necessary to deal with these cases, and to
restrain the offending churchmen, by bringing pressure to bear upon
their prelates and superiors.</p>
<p>The provincial governors also had certain military duties. In the
northern provinces of New Spain they had charge of defense, with
responsibility to the viceroy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1902src"
href="#xd21e1902" name="xd21e1902src">45</a> In the Philippines,
however, and in certain parts of New Spain, where the captain-general

character.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1921src" href="#xd21e1921" name=

"#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>authorized to impress men for
military service. Local conditions in Mexico, Per&uacute;, Central
America, and the Philippines caused some differentiation in these
matters. This description will serve to convey an impression of the
nature of the duties of these officials and the way in which they acted
as the agents of the captain-general, viceroy, and audiencia.<a class=

<p>It has been already pointed out that the <i lang="es">alcaldes
mayores</i> and <i lang="es">corregidores</i> had extensive judicial
duties; a mere restatement of that important fact will suffice at this
time. In subsequent chapters we shall study in detail numerous
illustrations and instances of the judicial functions of the provincial
judges. It has been noted also that the <i lang="es">alcaldes
ordinarios</i> were the judges of the Spanish towns. So they were in
the Philippines, but, as there were only four or five Spanish towns in
the archipelago, the <i lang="es">alcaldes ordinarios</i> do not assume
great prominence in this study. These <i lang="es">alcaldes</i> were
usually chosen by the <i lang="es">ayuntamientos</i> (municipal
councils), though they were appointed on some occasions by the
governors. As the Spanish towns enjoyed special privileges conferred by
the king, their judges were not a part of the regular judicial
hierarchy, but were dependent on their <i lang="es">ayuntamientos</i>
or the governor. However, an <i lang="es">oidor</i> was usually
delegated to inspect the work of the <i lang="es">alcalde
ordinario</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=

<p>With this introductory view of the general field of Spanish colonial
administration, and this presentation of the characters and elements
which are to assume important roles in this discussion because of their
frequent relations with the audiencia, we may enter upon a more
detailed study of a single institution. It has been emphasized
especially that the audiencia in the Philippines was only an integral
part of the governmental machinery used in the colonial empire of
Spain. It is clear, therefore, that we are not studying an isolated
tribunal, for every royal <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> promulgated to
the Philippine audiencia was in some way related to those issued to ten
or eleven other audiencias of equal status or similar character.
Although the Philippines were apart physically, this institution, with
its relation to the provincial and colonial governments on one hand,
and the home government on the other, brought the colony as close as
possible to Spain, and to the other colonies.</p>
<p>It is certain that the growth of audiencias was a part, not only of
colonial, but of Spanish historical and institutional development.
These institutions served the same purpose in the colonies that they
accomplished in Spain; they were utilized for the administration of
justice, and to check the excesses and abuses of officials. They were
important because they facilitated a greater degree of centralization.
They converged the provincial, colonial, intercolonial and home
governments in the same manner as the audiencias in Spain brought about
unity in provincial and national judicial administration. <span class=

Linden, in his <i lang="fr">L&rsquo;expansion coloniale de
L&rsquo;Espagne</i> (p. 360), states that the Philippine audiencia
exercised fewer governmental functions than did the audiencias of New
Spain and Peru. It is true that the jurisdiction of the Audiencia of
Manila was confined to a territory which was politically and
economically of less importance to Spain and to the world in general
than New Spain and Per&uacute;. It is the conviction of the writer that
the distance and isolation of the Philippines, their proximity to
Japan, China, and the hostile colonies of the Portuguese and the Dutch,
the necessities of self-dependence and defense, the corruption of the
governors and officials and the problem of dealing independently with
the ecclesiastical organization within the colony, forced the Audiencia
of Manila to take upon itself powers and responsibilities as extensive,
at least, as were assumed by the Audiencia of Mexico.</p>

was usually an ordinary judge, not always trained in the law to the
extent of being a <i lang="es">letrado</i> or <i lang="es">togado</i>.
An <i lang="es">alcalde ordinario</i> or an <i lang="es">alcalde de

mayor</i> or an <i lang="es">alcalde de partido</i> might try cases on

members of the town <i lang="es">ayuntamientos</i> or <i lang=

the early Spanish colonies the <i lang="es">alcalde</i> was elected by
his fellow-townsmen. He exercised the functions of judge and chief
executive, subject to the governor, or <i lang="es">adelantado</i>, and
in the absence of the latter assumed the government of the colony.
<i lang="es">Alcaldes</i> in new settlements or on expeditions were
different in character and exercised functions distinct from those of
the <i lang="es">alcaldes</i> of the later periods. This earlier type
probably existed in Espa&ntilde;ola under Columbus (see Bancroft,
<i>History of Central America</i>, I, 175, 330, note 7). That their
duties varied in different colonies may be deduced from the statement
of Bancroft that &ldquo;the <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> of New
Spain under Cort&eacute;s were merely entrusted with judicial powers
... later those of San Lu&iacute;s Potos&iacute; and other places acted
also as lieutenants for captains-general, and exercised, in other
respects, the duties and ceremonies of governors&rdquo; (Bancroft,
<i>History of Mexico</i>, III, 520). The term, therefore, does not
always convey a clear impression of the exact nature of the duties
attached to the office.</p>

royal decree of March 24, 1834, the <i lang="es">Consejo de
Castilla</i> and the <i lang="es">Consejo de Indias</i> were
amalgamated. In place of these was created the <i lang="es">Tribunal
Supremo de Espa&ntilde;a &eacute; Indias</i>, with judicial functions
and a <i lang="es">Consejo Real de Espa&ntilde;a &eacute; Indias</i>
for governmental and administrative affairs. On September 28, 1836, the
<i lang="es">Consejo Real de Espa&ntilde;a &eacute; Indias</i> was
suppressed. On July 6, 1845, the <i lang="es">Consejo de Estado</i>
assumed charge of affairs pertaining to the Indies, with a separate
<i lang="es">Ministerio de Ultramar</i>. This reform was re-enacted on
September 24, 1853 (Mart&iacute;nez Alcubilla, <i lang=
"es">Diccionario</i>, III, 313&ndash;315; Escriche, <i lang=

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e764" href="#xd21e764src" name="xd21e764">18</a></span> It became
the practice in later years to reward successful colonial
administrators, including viceroys, governors, and magistrates, with
membership in this council. Among those so elevated were Juan
Sol&oacute;rzano y Pereyra, magistrate of the Audiencia of Per&uacute;,
Jos&eacute; de G&aacute;lvez, visitor of New Spain, Governor
Sim&oacute;n de Anda y Salazar, and the able <i lang="es">fiscal</i>,
Francisco Leandro de Viana, of the Philippines. These men rendered very
distinguished service in the colonies.</p>

sentenced civil suits in an audiencia (Escriche, <i lang=
"es">Diccionario</i>, II, 661). In this treatise the Spanish term
<i lang="es">oidor</i> will be retained throughout to designate a
magistrate of that particular class. <i lang="es">Oidor</i> is
sometimes incorrectly translated into &ldquo;auditor&rdquo;, which in
English means a reviewer of accounts (Spanish, <i lang=
"es">contador</i>). The Spanish term <i lang="es">auditor</i> has a
special meaning, referring to a particular kind of magistrate, as
<i lang="es">auditor de guerra</i>, <i lang="es">auditor de marina</i>
or <i lang="es">auditor de rota</i> (Escriche, <i lang=
"es">Diccionario</i>, I, 369&ndash;371). Blair and Robertson, in their
<i>Philippine Islands</i> (Cleveland, 1908), have used the terms
<i lang="es">oidor</i> and &ldquo;auditor&rdquo; interchangeably, or
rather, in almost all cases they have translated <i lang="es">oidor</i>
as &ldquo;auditor&rdquo;, but this usage will not be followed here for
the reasons given.</p>
<p class="footnote">The <i lang="es">oidor</i> is also to be
distinguished from the <i lang="es">alcalde del crimen</i>. The latter
existed only in the larger audiencias of Mexico and Per&uacute;, or in
Manila, Havana or Puerto Rico in the later nineteenth century. <i lang=
"es">Alcaldes del crimen</i> in the sixteenth, seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries were subordinate in rank to <i lang=
"es">oidores</i>, but by virtue of the reforms of 1812, 1836 and 1837,
the latter were required to be <i lang="es">togados</i>, and the
ministers of all the audiencias were placed in the same class.

(Madrid, 1647). This was the first great general work on the political
institutions of the Indies, and probably the most valuable and
comprehensive of its kind ever published, barring possibly the <i lang=

discussions of suits and cases, litigation and legal citations. Its
ample title-page states that it is &ldquo;divided into six books, in
which, with great distinction and study, are treated and resolved all
matters relating to the discovery, description, acquisition and
retention of the Indies, and their peculiar government, as well as
concerning the persons of the Indians and their services, tributes,
tithes and <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>, as concerning spiritual and
ecclesiastical affairs and doctrine, inquisitors, commissaries of
crusade and of the religious. And in regard to temporal affairs,
concerning the secular magistrates, viceroys, presidents, audiencias,
the Supreme Council and its <i lang="es">junta de guerra</i>, including

first attempt at the codification of the laws for the governing of the
colonies was made in New Spain in 1545, when the ordinances for the
government of that viceroyalty and audiencia were printed. This
collection was given the royal approval in 1548. A similar compilation
was made in Per&uacute; in 1552 by Viceroy Mendoza. The first
intimation of a universal code is to be found in the recommendations of
the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> of the Council of the Indies, Francisco
Hern&aacute;ndez de Liebana, in 1552. On September 4, 1560, Lu&iacute;s
Velasco, viceroy of New Spain, was ordered to print a compilation of
laws for the Audiencia of Mexico. This commission was given to Oidor
Puga of that tribunal and executed in 1563. In 1569 Viceroy Francisco
Toledo was ordered to make a similar compilation for Per&uacute;, but
the work was not completed at that time. The first volume actually
printed by authority of the Council was accomplished in 1593. This was
the beginning of the code of the Indies, but the volume which was
published pertained only to the regimen of the Council of the Indies
itself, and made no regulations for the colonies. A more extensive
collection of provisions, letters, orders and <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dulas</i> was published on the authority of the Council
by Diego de Encinas, a clerk of that tribunal, in 1596. In 1603, the
<i lang="es">Ordenanzas reales para la Casa de Contrataci&oacute;n de
Sevilla y para otras cosas de las Indias</i> were printed in the same
city. Another ordinance was published for the regulation of the
<i lang="es">contadur&iacute;a mayor</i>.</p>
<p class="footnote">Various compilations were made by the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> from time to time, either for their own use, or in
compliance with the royal commands. Among the latter, perhaps the most
famous and certainly the most useful was that of Juan de
Sol&oacute;rzano y Pereyra, <i lang="es">oidor</i> of the Audiencia of
Per&uacute; and later a member of the Council of the Indies. This
collection was made at Lima in compliance with the commission of Philip
IV, issued in 1610. The work, consisting of six volumes, received the
stamp of royal approval on July 3, 1627. In 1623 Le&oacute;n Pinelo
published a <i lang="es">Discurso sobre la importancia, forma, y
disposici&oacute;n de la recopilaci&oacute;n de leyes de Indias</i>. On
April 19 of that year Pinelo was ordered to make an examination of all
the existing laws and <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> relative to the
government of the colonies, printed or in manuscript, with a view to
codification. A magistrate named Aguilar y Acu&ntilde;a was ordered to
collaborate with him. The result of these proceedings was a <i lang=
"es">Sumario de la Recopilaci&oacute;n General</i>, which continued
under process of compilation for a half century. It was finally
perfected and published in 1677. In 1668 Pinelo&rsquo;s work was issued
as the <i lang="es">Autos acordados y decretos de gobierno del Real y
Supremo Consejo de las Indias</i>.</p>
<p class="footnote">Although the collection was practically ready by
1677, it was not officially accepted until May 18, 1680. On that day it
was promulgated by Charles II, king of Spain. On November 1, 1681, the
work was ordered published by the India House, and the <i lang=
"es">Recopilaci&oacute;n de los Reynos de Indias</i> was issued at
Madrid in four volumes. Subsequent editions were printed in 1754, 1774,
1791 and 1841. The last-mentioned contains in its index reforms down to
1820. A <i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n Sumaria</i> was published in
Mexico in two volumes in 1787. The compilations of Zamora y Coronado,
Rodr&iacute;guez San Pedro and P&eacute;rez y L&oacute;pez, cited
repeatedly in this work, contain later laws, and serve in the place of
the <i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i> for the more recent
periods.</p>

Bancroft (<i>History of Central America</i>, I, 297) defines the
<i lang="es">corregidor</i> as a magistrate with civil and criminal
jurisdiction in the first instance, and gubernatorial inspection in the
political and economic government of all the towns of the district
assigned to him. There were <i lang="es">corregidores letrados</i>
(learned in the law), <i lang="es">corregidores pol&iacute;ticos</i>
(political and administrative), <i lang="es">de capa y espada</i>
(military) and <i lang="es">pol&iacute;ticos y militares</i>
(administrative and military). When the <i lang="es">corregidor</i> was
not a lawyer by profession, unless he had an <i lang="es">asesor</i> of
his own, the <i lang="es">alcalde mayor</i>, if possessed of legal
knowledge, became his advisor, which greatly increased the importance
of the last-mentioned official. The <i lang="es">alcalde mayor</i> was
appointed by the king. It was required that he should be a lawyer by
profession, twenty-six years of age, and of good character.
Practically, in cases of this kind, when the governor was not a
<i lang="es">letrado</i>, civil, criminal, and some phases of military
authority devolved on the <i lang="es">alcalde mayor</i>; the first two
ex-officio, and the latter as the legal advisor of the military chief.
In new colonies this officer was invested with powers almost equal to
those of the governor.&mdash;See <i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>,

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER II</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE AUDIENCIA OF MANILA
(1583&ndash;1598).</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The conditions which determined the establishment of
an audiencia in the Philippines differed little, if at all, from those
in Spain&rsquo;s other colonies. All of Spain&rsquo;s dependencies were
situated at great distances from the mother country; the Philippines
were farther away than any. Furthermore, the Philippines were isolated
and could not be successfully maintained, if dependent on, or
identified with any other colony; distance and other factors which we
shall note made undesirable and impracticable a continuance of
established relations with New Spain. If, however, the governor of the
Philippines came to be almost absolute in his authority, his absolutism
differed in degree rather than in kind from that of the governors and
viceroys of other colonies. The contiguity of China and Japan, the
constant danger of military invasion and naval attack by outside
enemies and the dependence of the colony on the commerce of China also
made the case of the Philippines somewhat different from that of the
colonies in America. In general, the situation in the Philippines
called for a distinct audiencia with the same powers and functions as
were exercised by the audiencias of the other colonies.</p>
<p>A system for the administration of justice in the Philippines had
been definitely established and organized before the audiencia was
inaugurated in 1584. Many prominent features of the judicial and
administrative systems of Spain and America had been already introduced
into the Islands. At the head of both judicial and administrative
affairs was the governor and captain-general, who was practically
absolute, and whose authority was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33"
href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>final except in certain matters
of litigation which could be appealed to the Audiencia of Mexico.
Subordinate to him were the <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> and
<i lang="es">corregidores,</i> whose functions have been already noted.
In the Philippines, as elsewhere, the latter officials acted as
magistrates and governors of provinces, combining judicial and
administrative attributes. Directly subordinate to them were the
<i lang="es">encomenderos,</i> whose holdings, including lands and
Indians, may be said to have constituted the unit of the Spanish
colonial land system until the close of the eighteenth
century.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2040src" href="#xd21e2040" name=
"xd21e2040src">1</a> As in Spain, so in the Spanish towns of the
Philippines, there were <i lang="es">alcaldes ordinarios,</i> or
municipal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>judges, elected by the citizens in some cases, or
appointed by the governor in others.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2112src" href="#xd21e2112" name="xd21e2112src">2</a></p>
<p>But the system as established was defective in many respects. The
governor and captain-general was chief judge, executive, and commander
of the military forces. In him were centralized all the functions of
justice and government, exercised in the provinces through the <i lang=
"es">alcaldes mayores</i> and <i lang="es">corregidores.</i> The latter
officials he appointed <i lang="la">ad interim,</i> supervised their
administrative duties, and heard judicial cases appealed from them. He
likewise exercised supervision over the <i lang="es">oficiales
reales,</i> who were entrusted with the collection, care and
expenditure of the funds of the colony.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2132src" href="#xd21e2132" name="xd21e2132src">3</a> During the
period before the establishment of the audiencia, the governor
exercised complete control over all branches and departments of the
government,&mdash;provincial, municipal, and insular&mdash;in matters
of justice, administration, and finance. The centralization of all this
authority in the person of one official made his position responsible
and powerful, but capable of much abuse. And it was the abuses
incidental to the exercise of absolute power by the governor that led
to the establishment of the Audiencia of Manila.</p>
<p>Probably the most important indirect reason for the establishment of
an audiencia in the Philippines may be noted in the abuses connected
with the administration of the <i lang="es">encomiendas.</i> These may
be attributed both to the powerlessness and inefficiency <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>of the
governors, and to their cupidity and deliberate favoritism to the
<i lang="es">encomenderos.</i> As a result of the rapid spread of these
<i lang="es">encomiendas,</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e2168src" href=
"#xd21e2168" name="xd21e2168src">4</a> settlements, or agricultural
estates, for such they were, and their location in distant and widely
separated parts of the Archipelago, the <i lang="es">encomenderos</i>
came to have increased responsibilities and powers. They were far
removed from the central authority at Manila. They were infrequently
inspected by the <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> and <i lang=
"es">corregidores</i> in whose districts they were situated. Indeed,
the <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> had spread so rapidly in the
Philippines that the governmental machinery provided by Spain was
unable to provide for them. In 1591, for example, there were 267
<i lang="es">encomiendas</i> containing 667,612 souls. These were
supervised by twelve <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores.</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2242src" href="#xd21e2242" name="xd21e2242src">5</a>
One hundred and forty priests were provided to minister to this large
congregation of natives. The Philippine government, with an autocratic
military governor at its head, had been originally designed for one
settlement or province, and not for an extensive <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>military
possession, distributed over a widely separated area, with insufficient
means of communication and transportation. Under the conditions
outlined above, the <i lang="es">encomenderos</i> were permitted to
forget the benign purposes for which they had been originally entrusted
with the care and protection of the natives. The Indians on the
<i lang="es">encomiendas</i> were reduced to the condition of slaves.
They were mistreated, overtaxed, overworked, cheated, neglected,
flogged, and abused.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2257src" href=
"#xd21e2257" name="xd21e2257src">6</a> Their protectors had become
their exploiters. The churchmen who were supposed to act as their
guardians and spiritual aids were insufficient in number to render
effective service. Many of the latter served the interests of the
<i lang="es">encomenderos,</i> and the latter were decidedly
unfavorable to the introduction of more priests. The local officials of
government and justice were in most cases too far away to care for and
protect the natives, or even to visit the more remote <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i> in their districts. Moreover, many of them were
themselves <i lang="es">encomenderos,</i> perpetrating abuses on their
own tenants, and accordingly little inclined to sacrifice their own
interests for the protection of the natives on other <i lang=
"es">encomiendas.</i> Finally, the governor, located at the distant
capital, was possibly ignorant of the real state of affairs; at any
rate, he failed to enforce the laws which commanded humane treatment of
the natives, leaving to the <i lang="es">encomenderos,</i> the <i lang=
"es">alcaldes mayores,</i> and <i lang="es">corregidores</i> the
administration of the provinces and the supervision of the <i lang=
"es">encomiendas.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e2300src" href=
"#xd21e2300" name="xd21e2300src">7</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>Efforts had been made for the correction of these abuses and to
bring about a more effective control of the <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i> by the governor. Early in the history of the
Islands the king had empowered governors and viceroys to grant <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i> for life, with thirty years&rsquo; remission of
tribute, to those who had participated in the conquest. Legaspi and
Lavezares, the first two governors of the Philippines, had given
<i lang="es">encomiendas</i> without limit to favorites, relatives, and
friends; consequently, when Sande became governor, he was obliged to
direct much of his attention to the eradication of the resultant evils,
and he attempted to establish the <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> on a
profitable and honest basis. He dispossessed many of the holders of
these large tracts, and reserved them for the crown, as royal <i lang=
"es">encomiendas,</i> thus creating a revenue for the newly established
and financially embarrassed government.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2333src" href="#xd21e2333" name="xd21e2333src">8</a> Sande made
royal many of the hitherto unprofitable <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>
which had been in private hands.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2339src"
href="#xd21e2339" name="xd21e2339src">9</a> On account of these acts
Sande became very unpopular <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href=
"#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>in Manila, and so unpleasant were his
relations with the residents that, having no protection or recourse, he
was obliged to give up his command, practically driven from the Islands
by his enemies.</p>
<p>The only person in the Philippines who exercised any sort of check
on the governor was the bishop, with whom he was ordered to consult
frequently. These consultations were often productive of bitter
quarrels. The first prelate of the Philippines, Bishop Salazar, arrived
in 1581, and throughout his ecclesiastical administration exercised
influence of a far-reaching character. It was he who first showed the
need of a royal audiencia to check the encroachments of the governor on
the prerogatives of the church, for the protection of the natives, and
for the safeguarding of the royal interests. Bishop Salazar was a
determined opponent of Governor Sande, whom he accused of excessive
indulgence in trade and the extortion of large sums from the <i lang=
"es">encomenderos.</i> On June 20, 1582, he wrote to the Council:
&ldquo;if I were as rich as Governor Sande, I would engage to pay any
sum of money.&rdquo; He also testified that &ldquo;the government here
is a place for the enrichment of governors; they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>carry
away as much as 400,000 ducats, knowing that they will have to pay a
share of it at the <i lang="es">residencia,</i> but they steal enough
to do that also.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2409src" href=
"#xd21e2409" name="xd21e2409src">10</a></p>
<p>The government of the Philippines, prior to the establishment of the
Audiencia of Manila, during the period 1565&ndash;1584, was subordinate
to the viceroy and to the audiencia in Mexico. The time required for
the transmission of documents and correspondence, the fewness of ships
available for the voyage between the Philippines and New Spain, and the
unsatisfactory means of communication resulting therefrom, seriously
inconvenienced the residents of the colony. In matters of government
and justice appeals had to be taken to Mexico. This proceeding involved
great loss of time and expense, and was especially inimical to the
administration of justice. The assignment and regulation of <i lang=
"es">encomiendas,</i> the supervision of financial affairs, the control
of the Chinese trade, the dispatch of the galleons to New Spain, and
the assignment of cargo-space on these ships, were all matters which,
at that great distance, and at that time, called for divided control.
The execution of all these duties was too great a charge for the human
frailties of one man; the governor could do it neither honestly nor
well. The necessity was apparent of having a central government in
Manila which would be self-sufficient in itself; that is, independent
of New Spain, and at the same time capable of repairing its own
defects.</p>
<p>The relations which existed between the Manila government and the
authorities of New Spain are illustrated by a letter which Governor
Gonzalo Ronquillo de Pe&ntilde;alosa wrote a month later than the
correspondence above alluded to. In this letter he announced the
arrival of a ship from Mexico, which, he said, bore nothing but charges
against him. These complaints, he alleged, had been formulated by
agents of Dr. Francisco de Sande, his predecessor, whose <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> he had conducted and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>whom he had deprived of
his office as governor. Ronquillo wrote that</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">nevertheless, Sande has been received in that royal
audiencia of Mexico as <i lang="es">oidor,</i> as a result of which all
those who love justice may well despair. They meddle with my government
from Mexico, giving orders to my <i lang="es">corregidores</i> without
consulting me, and addressing private individuals in regard to the
supplies, directing them to keep watch over this or that matter; they
impose grave penalties upon me, and no matter how small the affair may
be, they refuse to listen to me or to hear my side of the
question.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2433src" href="#xd21e2433" name=
"xd21e2433src">11</a></p>
</div>
<p>He concluded by pointing out the inconsistency of his position,
subject as he was to Sande, the man whom he had displaced because of
the former&rsquo;s unfitness to occupy the post of governor. Although
Governor Ronquillo de Pe&ntilde;alosa did not ask for an audiencia on
this occasion, he did petition for an educated assistant to aid him in
the administration of justice. &ldquo;The trouble here,&rdquo; he wrote
to the king, in the letter above quoted, &ldquo;is that the people are
of such a nature that, at the same time when justice is done to one, an
enemy is made of another person.&rdquo; The rule of Ronquillo de
Pe&ntilde;alosa as governor was distinctly typical of the possibilities
of an absolute executive, far removed from the restraining influence of
the courts, with scarcely any limitation upon his operations. Appointed
as he had been for life, with proprietary attributes, and with the
power of naming his successor, Ronquillo de Pe&ntilde;alosa was the
first governor sent out from Spain in pursuance of the policy of
entrusting frontier commands to military men who were fitted by
profession and experience to deal with situations which demanded the
qualities of the soldier, rather than those of the administrator and
<span class="corr" id="xd21e2438" title=
"Source: politcian">politician</span>. An attempt thus seems to have
been made to remedy the ills which had been characteristic of the
administration of Lavezares and Sande by entrusting the governor with
more centralized power&mdash;an attempt to correct <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>the
evils of absolutism with the mailed fist and more absolutism, backed by
military power.</p>
<p>The bishop, who at this time kept the court well informed of the
weaknesses of the government, as they appeared to him, sent many
complaints against Ronquillo de Pe&ntilde;alosa, as other churchmen had
done against former governors. Not only did the bishop himself write
repeatedly, but he influenced the municipal and ecclesiastical chapters
of Manila to send protests against the governor&rsquo;s misrule. It was
largely owing to Salazar&rsquo;s influence that Captain Gabriel de
Rivera (or Ribera) was sent to Spain with a petition signed by most of
the influential men of the colony, asking for various reforms. Among
these the establishment of a royal audiencia was especially
requested.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2446src" href="#xd21e2446" name=
"xd21e2446src">12</a></p>
<p>On the occasion of Ronquillo&rsquo;s death in 1583, the bishop
called attention to the straits into which the colony had fallen as a
result of the tyrannical methods of the deceased governor.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2454src" href="#xd21e2454" name=
"xd21e2454src">13</a> He described Ronquillo&rsquo;s efforts to prevent
residents from appealing to the audiencia and viceroy of New Spain. He
stated that the Indians had been unjustly treated by the <i lang=
"es">encomenderos</i> and <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores,</i> for when
appeals had been made to the governor, the latter, on a plea of being
too busy to occupy himself with such minute details, had ordered the
<i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> to settle the questions at issue
without disturbing him. Ronquillo was said to have engaged extensively
in commerce, monopolizing the ships to the exclusion of the merchants,
and forcing large loans from the officials and residents, who did not
dare to refuse him, lest all their privileges be taken from them. He
had established private <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> in nearly every
town in Luzon, appropriating the income therefrom, instead of turning
the proceeds into the royal treasury.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2471src" href="#xd21e2471" name="xd21e2471src">14</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>This the prelate conceded to be in accordance with
the conditions of the governor&rsquo;s appointment, but it was
nevertheless unjust, as the privilege of holding <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i> was denied to other officials, and the treasury of
the colony was in need of the revenue which had been daily enriching
the governor. The bishop accused the governor of seizing Indians,
placing them <i lang="es">en encomienda</i> wherever and whenever he
found them, irrespective of whether they were already free, or whether
they belonged on other <i lang="es">encomiendas.</i> These acts, he
said, had caused the Indians to be dissatisfied and rebellious, and he
evidently was of the opinion that a revolt was impending when he penned
this memorial. &ldquo;Many times I have prayed,&rdquo; he wrote,
&ldquo;that God should close the natives&rsquo; eyes in order that they
may not see the weakness and the little power with which we might
resist them in case they should arise to put down these evils.&rdquo;
The bishop closed this memorial with a vigorous protest against the
continuance of the hereditary principle in the succession of governors
in the Philippines. He made the general recommendation that in the
future governors should be appointed by the king, with a view to
securing men of administrative and executive ability. He brought forth
strenuous objections to the accession of the ex-governor&rsquo;s
nephew. Diego Ronquillo de Pe&ntilde;alosa, who was not fitted to
occupy the post of governor. If the latter assumed the government, the
bishop could see nothing in store for the colony but a continuation of
the evil days which had been extant throughout the administration of
the elder Ronquillo, &ldquo;who had spent all his time in gathering
wealth for himself by means of trade, shutting his eyes and ears to
those who asked justice of him.&rdquo; Salazar expressed the opinion
that &ldquo;had Gonzalo Ronquillo de Pe&ntilde;alosa <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>spent as
much of his time in making conquests and discoveries as he had in
making packages [of merchandise], the prosperity of the Islands and the
general welfare would have been his chief aim.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2502src" href="#xd21e2502" name="xd21e2502src">15</a></p>
<p>Although the decree establishing an audiencia in the Philippines was
promulgated before the above memorial reached court, there is no
question but that the influence of Bishop Salazar did much towards
bringing about the creation of a tribunal in the Islands. Indeed,
Salazar has been given all the credit for this by more than one
authority.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2508src" href="#xd21e2508" name=
"xd21e2508src">16</a> While the bishop did exert an important influence
in bringing about this change, the support which he received from
residents of the colony was also of immense advantage. Many
individuals, aggrieved by the abuses of the executive, wrote vigorous
complaints against &ldquo;the tyranny of an absolute governor, who
alone and unchecked, reserves to himself excessive power.&rdquo; Their
letters emphasize the injustice of having appeals carried to Mexico,
&ldquo;where the people of Manila never get their deserts, and where
they suffer on account of the distance.&rdquo; Various <i lang=
"es">encomenderos</i> had been wronged by the acts of the governor in
dividing their <i lang="es">encomiendas,</i> and reducing the number of
Indians thereon; they had appealed to Mexico, and after waiting over
two years, had despaired of ever getting any return for the money and
the time which they had spent in litigation at the distant capital. As
a possible means of relief they requested the establishment of a royal
audiencia at Manila.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2523src" href=
"#xd21e2523" name="xd21e2523src">17</a></p>
<p>Another person who exerted considerable influence toward the
establishment of an audiencia in the Philippines was Captain Gabriel de
Rivera, who went to Madrid for that purpose. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>He was
the first <i lang="es">procurador general de las islas del
poniente,</i> and it was his duty to represent at court the needs of
the colony, and of its inhabitants.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2533src"
href="#xd21e2533" name="xd21e2533src">18</a> Rivera acted as the
personal agent of Salazar in his advocacy of the establishment of an
audiencia, and it was largely due to his efforts that the institution
was established when it was. In his memorial of February 16, 1582,
Rivera criticized the existing administration in the Philippines, the
proprietary governorship, and the control over commerce which the
governor had exercised. The latter had levied the <i lang=
"es">almojarifazgo</i> and other customs duties in defiance of the
royal <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> forbidding them, and without
consulting the wishes of the merchants or officials. Rivera alleged
that the <i lang="es">almojarifazgo</i> and the <i lang=
"es">alcabala</i> were ruining the commerce of the Islands.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2570src" href="#xd21e2570" name=
"xd21e2570src">19</a> His memorial treated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>extensively of the abuses which had occurred in
the administration of the <i lang="es">encomiendas,</i> and he pointed
out numerous defects in the judicial system of the colonies.</p>
<p>He suggested the establishment of a royal audiencia to consist of
three judges, having criminal and civil jurisdiction, without appeal to
any other tribunal than the Council of the Indies. The audiencia as
outlined by him was to have administrative powers as well as judicial;
it was to govern as a commission, with a governor at its head, chosen
for a term of six years.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2677src" href=
"#xd21e2677" name="xd21e2677src">20</a> This scheme, he said, if put
into operation, would result <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href=
"#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>in no increased expense to the crown
or colony. He proposed the abolition of the three <i lang=
"es">oficiales reales,</i> suggesting the substitution of three
<i lang="es">oidores</i> in their places, thus extending the
jurisdiction of the audiencia to matters of finance. The new tribunal
should likewise take cognizance of the assignment of <i lang=
"es">encomiendas,</i> and see that in all cases the royal will was
obeyed. The audiencia should exercise supervision over the <i lang=
"es">alcaldes mayores</i> in their relation to the <i lang=
"es">encomiendas,</i> with a view to remedying the existing abuses and
seeing that justice was done to the Indians. The audiencia should hear
cases appealed from the <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> and <i lang=
"es">corregidores</i> instead of allowing these suits to be heard by
the governor or sent to Mexico. Rivera also urged that there should be
a special <i>defender of the Indians</i> as a part of the
audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2707src" href="#xd21e2707" name=
"xd21e2707src">21</a></p>
<p>Enough has been noted of the evils of the government as it existed
before the establishment of the audiencia to understand <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>the
reasons for the creation of the tribunal. The whole matter summarizes
itself in the excesses of the governor, and the necessity of protecting
all classes of society from his absolutism. These abuses called for the
establishment of a tribunal nearer than New Spain, which would, in a
safe and expeditious manner, impose the necessary limitations upon the
governor, insure an equitable collection and an economical expenditure
of the public revenue, and bring about particularly the elimination of
official corruption. It was desirable to protect the merchant in his
legitimate business, to insure stability in the relations of church and
state, and to obviate the existing evils in the administration of the
provincial governments. The latter meant the assignment of <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i> in accordance with the law to deserving
individuals instead of to friends and relatives of the governors, or to
other prominent officials of the colony. It also meant that the natives
on these <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> should be protected from the
rapacity of the <i lang="es">encomenderos.</i> It was realized that an
effort should be made to insure the imparting of religious instruction
to the natives in partial return for tribute paid by them. Finally, it
meant the establishment of a tribunal which would have power to enforce
the law prescribing that the <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> and
<i lang="es">corregidores</i> should exercise faithful supervision over
these matters which were within their jurisdiction. A tribunal was
needed, not merely to hear such appeals as might come to it by process
of law, but with authority to intervene actively in affairs of
government, checking the abuses of the governor and protecting the
community from his absolutism.</p>
<p>The proposition to establish an independent audiencia in Manila was
opposed by the viceroy and audiencia of New Spain. The latter tribunal
wrote a letter of protest to the Council of the Indies, demanding that
in matters of government and justice the colony of the Philippines
should continue to bear the same relations to the viceroyalty of New
Spain as did Guadalajara.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2764src" href=
"#xd21e2764" name="xd21e2764src">22</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>Rivera answered these
objections in a special memorial, stating that the isolation of the
Philippines alone justified the establishment of an audiencia and an
independent government. He also pointed out that the nearness of Japan
and China and the necessity of dealing with them required the presence
of a sovereign tribunal in Manila. He asserted that the colony could
deal directly with the Council of the Indies more profitably than
through the Audiencia of Mexico. The latter mode of procedure was
indirect and cumbersome and it exposed litigants to the meddling of the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> of Mexico in matters which they did not
understand.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2778src" href="#xd21e2778" name=
"xd21e2778src">23</a></p>
<p>Finally, the Audiencia of Manila was established by decree of Philip
II on May 5, 1583, in the following terms:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Whereas in the interests of good government and the
administration of our justice, we have accorded the establishment in
the city of Manila in the Island of Luzon of one of our royal
audiencias and chanceries, in which there shall be a president, three
<i lang="es">oidores,</i> a <i lang="es">fiscal,</i> and the necessary
officials; and whereas we have granted that this audiencia should have
the same authority and preeminence as each one of our royal audiencias
which sit in the town of Valladolid and the city of Granada of these
our realms, and the other audiencias of our Indies: now therefore we
order to be made and sent to the said Island our royal seal, with which
are to be stamped our decisions which are made and issued by the said
president and <i lang="es">oidores</i> in the said audiencia.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2795src" href="#xd21e2795" name=
"xd21e2795src">24</a></p>
</div>
<p>The jurisdiction of the tribunal, it is to be noted, extended
throughout the Island of Luzon and the rest of the islands of the
Archipelago, as well as over &ldquo;the mainland of China, whether
discovered or yet to be discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The decree which provided for the foundation of the Audiencia of
Manila consisted of three hundred and thirteen sections. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>Although
the audiencia was subsequently abolished for a few years, it was
re-established in 1598 and these articles were again utilized. It is
therefore worth while to notice the most important provisions of the
law of establishment, which was to serve as a foundation for the
audiencia during a period of approximately three hundred years. The
first thirty-eight sections were devoted to the creation of the
tribunal, to a definition of its jurisdiction over civil and criminal
cases, and to a determination of the proper method of procedure in
them. The audiencia was to have authority to try cases of appeal from
<i lang="es">gobernadores</i>, <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i>, and
other magistrates of the provinces; it also had jurisdiction over civil
cases appealed from the <i lang="es">alcaldes ordinarios</i> of the
city and original jurisdiction over all criminal cases arising within
five leagues of the city of Manila. Appeals were to be tried by
<i lang="es">revista</i> (review) before the tribunal. Cases of first
instance (<i lang="es">vista</i>) were not to be tried in the tribunal,
excepting those to which the government was a party, or the
above-mentioned criminal cases. The judgment of the audiencia was
usually to be final in ordinary suits, and always in criminal cases.
Those involving the government, and civil suits exceeding a certain
value were appealable to the Council of the Indies. Notice of appeal to
the latter tribunal had to be served within one year after the
objectionable decision was rendered, and the party appealing the case
was obliged to post financial bonds covering the expenses of suit in
case the final judgment were not favorable to him. The decision of the
audiencia was to be executed in all cases, even though an appeal to the
Council of the Indies had been made. The procedure followed in the
chanceries of Valladolid and Granada was to be enforced in the
Audiencia of Manila except when the contrary was especially ordered.
Investigations might be made by one judge, but the concurrence of two
was necessary for all decisions involving the reversal of a former
judgment, or in cases wherein a certain amount was at stake. In the
latter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>case, an assistant judge might be chosen from
outside the audiencia to assist the regular magistrate.</p>
<p>The audiencia was forbidden to act alone in the selection of judges
of <i lang="es">residencias</i> or <i lang="es">pesquisidores</i>; it
was commanded not to interfere with governors of provinces, but it had
the right, when, charges had been made by private individuals, to
conduct investigations of governors&rsquo; official conduct. The
audiencia was empowered to investigate the judges of provinces.
Magistrates were forbidden to hear cases affecting themselves or their
relatives, and when a case involving more than one thousand pesos was
before the tribunal, and no <i lang="es">oidor</i> was eligible to try
it, an <i lang="es">alcalde ordinario</i> might serve in the place of a
regular magistrate, with appeal to the Council of the Indies. Criminal
charges against the <i lang="es">oidores</i> were to be tried by the
president, with the assistance, if need be, of such <i lang=
"es">alcaldes ordinarios</i> as the latter might select. No relative of
the president or of an <i lang="es">oidor</i> could be appointed
legally to a corregidor-ship or to an <i lang="es">encomienda</i>.
<i lang="es">Oidores</i> were eligible for appointment by the president
from time to time to inspect the administration of justice and
government in the provinces.</p>
<p><i lang="es">Oidores</i> were forbidden to receive fees from or to
act as advocates for any private person, and they could not hold
income-yielding estates in arable land or cattle. <i lang=
"es">Oidores</i> were forbidden to engage in business, either singly or
in partnership, nor could they avail themselves of the compulsory
services of Indians under pain of deprivation of office. Any person
could bring suit against an <i lang="es">oidor</i>. As noted above,
such cases would either be tried by the president or by an <i lang=
"es">alcalde ordinario</i> on the president&rsquo;s designation. Such
cases might be appealed to the Council of the Indies.</p>
<p>The audiencia, according to the terms of its establishment, had
extensive authority over matters of government. In case of the death or
incapacity of the president, the audiencia was to assume control of
affairs, the senior <i lang="es">oidor</i> filling the post of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>president and captain-general, with special charge
over military matters. Under such circumstances the administrative and
executive functions were to be administered by the audiencia as a body.
The governor, who was also president of the audiencia, was ordered to
make a complete report annually to the Council of the Indies on the
state of the government and the finances of the colony, including an
account of the gross income and expenditures, a survey of conditions of
the <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> and <i lang="es">corregimientos</i>,
as well as a report on the conduct of officials, including <i lang=
"es">oidores</i>. In fact, all matters that came regularly under the
care of the executive were to be covered in the annual report of the
governor and captain-general of the Islands.</p>
<p>The president was empowered to delegate the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i>, in turn, to make tours of inspection in the
provinces. The magistrates, as visitors, were to inquire into the
character of service rendered by the <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i>
in the administration of government and justice. They were to note the
state of the towns and their needs, the means taken for the
construction and preservation of public buildings, and the condition of
the Indians on the <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>. They were to see
whether they were faithfully and efficiently instructed in religion, or
whether they were permitted to live in ignorance and idolatry. Reports
were to be made by the visitors on the state of the soil, the condition
of the crops and harvests, extent of mineral wealth and timber in the
provinces under investigation, weights and measures, and in fact,
everything that had to do with the general welfare. On these trips the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> were authorized to take such action as they
felt to be necessary. Two <i lang="es">oidores</i> were also required
to make weekly inspections of the prisons of the colony.</p>
<p>The decree of establishment also directed that certain phases of
ecclesiastical affairs should claim the attention of the audiencia. The
chief duty of the tribunal in that regard was to keep the
ecclesiastical judges from exceeding their authority, and the practices
of the audiencias of Spain were especially <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>prescribed as a precedent for the local tribunal.
The audiencia was charged with supervision over the assignment of
benefices, and especially with the settlement of the property and
estates of bishops and archbishops who died in the Islands. The
audiencia was ordered to permit nothing to be done which would be in
prejudice of the rights and prerogatives of the church. The tribunal
was instructed to assist the prelates on all occasions when they
petitioned for royal aid. It was also to see that properly accredited
bulls were read and applied in the Spanish towns, but not in the native
villages.</p>
<p>As noted above, suits involving the royal treasury and the
collection of money for the government were to be reviewed and decided
before any other that might come up in the royal audiencia. It was the
duty of the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> to prosecute these cases in the
interest of the government. At the beginning of each year the president
and two magistrates were to audit the reports of the <i lang=
"es">oficiales reales</i>, and if these reports were not duly and
properly rendered, the salaries of these officials were to be withheld.
After auditing the accounts the committee was to count the money in the
royal treasury. The <i lang="es">oidores</i> who did this extra work
were to receive an allowance of twenty-five thousand <i lang=
"es">maraved&iacute;s</i> (about 56 pesos) in addition to their regular
salaries. The authorization of the audiencia was necessary for the
payment of extraordinary expenses not appearing in the regular budget
and these disbursements were made subject to the later approval of the
Council of the Indies. The audiencia was held responsible in these
matters by the Council. Full reports of expenditures made on the
responsibility of the audiencia were to be made to the Council, and the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> were held accountable in their <i lang=
"es">residencias</i> for their votes cast in the <i lang="es">junta</i>
or <i lang="es">acuerdo de hacienda</i>, as the committee was
called.</p>
<p>The audiencia was given supervision over the administration of the
estates of deceased persons; it was to examine the accounts of
executors and see that the wills of the deceased <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>were
faithfully executed and that all was done in accordance with the law.
For this purpose an <i lang="es">oidor</i> was delegated each year with
authority to dispose of these cases in the name of the audiencia. In a
subsequent chapter the duties and activities of this <i lang=
"es">administrador</i> or <i lang="es">juez de bienes de difuntos</i>
will be enlarged upon.</p>
<p>Considerable space in this decree was devoted to prescribing the
rules for the trial of cases involving Indians, with a view to securing
justice both in their administration by the <i lang=
"es">encomenderos</i> and in the supervision which the <i lang=
"es">alcaldes mayores</i> exercised over the <i lang=
"es">encomenderos</i>. The provision was made that &ldquo;our said
president and <i lang="es">oidores</i> shall always take great care to
be informed of the crimes and abuses which are committed against the
Indians under our royal crown, or against those granted in <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i> to other persons by the governors.&rdquo; The
audiencia was directed to exercise care that &ldquo;the said Indians
shall be better treated and instructed in our Holy Catholic Faith, as
our free vassals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The audiencia was required to exercise care that suits involving
Indians were neither lengthy nor involved, that decisions were reached
promptly and without unnecessary litigation, and that the rites,
customs, and practices to which the Indians had always been accustomed
should be continued in so far as was practicable. The audiencia and the
bishop were to see that there was a person appointed in each village to
give instruction in religion. <i lang="es">Alcaldes mayores</i> were
ordered not to dispossess native chiefs of their rule or authority;
they were, on the contrary, to appeal cases involving them without
delay to the audiencia, or to the visiting <i lang="es">oidor</i>. The
audiencia was to devote two days a week to hearing suits to which
Indians were parties. <i lang="es">Encomenderos</i> were to be
protected by the audiencia in the possession of their <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i>.</p>
<p>A proportionate amount of attention in this <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> is devoted to outlining the duties of the
<i lang="es">fiscal</i>, who, from many points of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>view,
was the most important official directly connected with the tribunal.
It was his function to appear as prosecutor for the government in all
cases tried before the audiencia, and he was forbidden to serve as the
advocate of any private person during his term of office. He should
devote his attention especially to matters involving the exchequer. He
was to prosecute all cases of appeal from the <i lang="es">alcaldes
mayores</i> and <i lang="es">corregidores</i> on behalf of the
government, and &ldquo;he was to take care to assist and favor poor
Indians in the suits that they have, and to see that they are not
oppressed, maltreated, or wronged.&rdquo; The <i lang="es">fiscal</i>,
ordinarily, was not to prosecute unless it were on the complaint of
some person, but in cases of notorious injustice, or when judicial
inquiry was being made, he could take the initiative on his own
account. It was his duty to perform any and all legal acts which were
consistent with his position, and which were designed to bring about
justice or to secure the royal interests.</p>
<p>The remaining sections of this decree, and, in fact, the greater
part of it, are devoted to establishing the duties of the <i lang=
"es">fiscal</i> and the minor officials of the audiencia, to fixing a
tariff of fees to be charged for notarial and other legal work and to
the determination of other matters which are of no great consequence to
the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p>Among the minor officials attached to the audiencia were the
<i lang="es">alguacil mayor</i> and his two deputies. These were to act
as the executive officers of the court and were empowered to make
arrests, serve papers and execute similar functions. Their duties, as a
whole, were much like those of the English or American constable or
sheriff. They might arrest, on their own initiative, persons whom they
caught in crime, as, for example, those playing forbidden games of
chance, or indulging in immoral practices, typical particularly of the
Chinese. The <i lang="es">alguacil</i> was responsible for the
maintenance of the prison of the audiencia; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>for this
purpose he could appoint a certain number of jail-wardens.</p>
<p>There were also clerks of court and notaries, chosen by royal
appointment. Their duties were those customarily required of such
officials, not differing from those of today. The audiencia likewise
had official reporters, similar to the court reporters of the present
day. Advocates and attorneys practicing before the audiencia had to
fulfill certain prescribed requirements in regard to learning,
training, and general ability. Receivers, bailiffs, jail-wardens and
interpreters each received their due amount of space and attention in
this <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i>. The interpreters were to assist
the Indians who were defending themselves in a Spanish-speaking court.
Among their duties was the translation of the testimony of witnesses,
of the questions of attorneys and the rulings of the courts into the
native dialects, or into the Spanish language, as the circumstances
might require. These interpreters were also required to assist the
natives in the formulation of legal documents. All these minor
officials were to be regulated in the collection of fees by a legal
tariff. Finally, the audiencia was provided with an archive within
which were to be deposited and kept the great seal of the government,
and all official papers, including records of cases and official
acts.</p>
<p>The new audiencia having been provided for, Santiago de Vera, the
recently appointed governor and captain-general of the Islands and
president of the new tribunal, arrived at Manila on May 28, 1584. In
accordance with the new law, it was his duty to govern the Philippines
in the capacity of executive and military commander, and at the same
time preside over the audiencia in its respective judicial, advisory,
and administrative capacities. The first session of the audiencia was
held on June 15, 1584.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3020src" href=
"#xd21e3020" name="xd21e3020src">25</a> The new tribunal was officially
brought into <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>being with much pomp and ceremony, including a
procession of the president and magistrates in their robes of office,
and the celebration of divine service in the cathedral by the bishop.
The president and each of the <i lang="es">oidores</i> subsequently
made lengthy reports to the Council of the Indies on the inauguration
of the tribunal.</p>
<p>The most direct and striking consequence of the establishment of the
audiencia in Manila was the discord which it engendered between the
various officials and functionaries of the government. Whereas, before
the inauguration of the tribunal, the chief ill of the colony had been
the unrivaled absolutism and the high-handed proceedings of the
governor, now, with the division of power newly effected, the creation
of new departments, and the checking of one official against another,
strife and contention took the place of despotism.</p>
<p>There were but few misunderstandings between the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> over their judicial duties. The functions of the
audiencia, as a court, were clearly defined and distinctly understood.
Although appeals were made from the audiencia to the Council of the
Indies, as appeals are always made from a minor court to a superior
tribunal, there was little dissatisfaction with the body in the
exercise of its purely legal functions. Its value in protecting the
natives on the <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> from the tyranny of their
masters, the facility rendered to the administration of justice by
making appeal to New Spain unnecessary, and the advantage of having
immediately at hand a tribunal with plenary powers were readily
recognized.</p>
<p>The chief objection to the tribunal developed as a result of the
audiencia&rsquo;s interference in matters of government and
administration. Disputes arose between the governor and the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i>, and among the <i lang="es">oidores</i> themselves.
The lack of experience in the local field of the president and
magistrates may have been one of the causes of the unsatisfactory
conditions immediately following the establishment of the audiencia.
Another <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>and possibly a more important reason lay in the
nature and wording of the articles of establishment. A certain amount
of confusion existed in the minds of all as to the extent of power
which the audiencia should have in governmental and ecclesiastical
affairs. No definite distinction had been drawn between the powers of
the president and those of the <i lang="es">oidores</i> in matters of
government, and the former at once accused the latter of infringing
upon the jurisdiction of the executive. The <i lang="es">oidores</i>,
on the other hand, claimed that their advice should be taken in all
matters of appointment, defense, patronage&mdash;both ecclesiastical
and secular&mdash;finance, commerce and interior administration. They
began to intervene actively in those matters, to the displeasure of the
governor and treasury officials. All the <i lang="es">oidores</i> as
well as the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, wrote lengthy memorials and
reports to the king, offering advice on this affair or that, and
criticising the governor, the bishop, and the <i lang="es">oficiales
reales</i> for acts done within their own spheres of authority. In
sending these reports and in making these suggestions, the magistrates
did not question their own authority and they resented exceedingly the
objections and charges of interference by those concerned.</p>
<p>An illustration may be noted in the letter written on July 3, 1584,
by Oidor Melchoir D&aacute;valos to the king. After several clear
intimations that he would like to be governor in case a vacancy should
arise and after modestly setting forth his own qualifications and
virtues, D&aacute;valos wrote a faithful and vivid account of the
expeditions which had been made recently against the Mohammedan Sulus.
He petitioned for a suspension of the law forbidding slavery in order
that Spaniards might avail themselves of captive Moros as
slaves.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3067src" href="#xd21e3067" name=
"xd21e3067src">26</a> He made several recommendations <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>in
regard to the Chinese, stating particularly that he was devoting
himself to a study of the kind of government best fitted for the
Chinese in Manila. He complained that the Chinese merchants were
draining the Islands of silver, bringing as many as thirty-four
shiploads of Chinese cargo a year. Since nothing of commercial value
was produced in the Philippines, they could take away nothing else than
silver. This incessant drain on the coin imported from Acapulco was
resulting in the impoverishment of the colony and constituted a source
of danger to New Spain as well. The exportation of money was contrary
to royal orders and distinctly prejudicial to the economic interests of
the realm. D&aacute;valos recommended immediate action in the matter.
He then discussed military affairs, alleging that the pay of the
soldiers was insufficient, and their condition miserable. The first and
third of the matters touched upon by the <i lang="es">oidor</i> in his
memorial, namely, the war in Mindanao and the condition of the
soldiers, belonged to the private jurisdiction of the governor and
captain-general,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3083src" href="#xd21e3083"
name="xd21e3083src">27</a> the control of the Chinese coming later
under the jurisdiction of the governor, as captain-general, with
special inhibition of the interference of the audiencia.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3088src" href="#xd21e3088" name=
"xd21e3088src">28</a></p>
<p>This letter furnishes a good illustration of the interference of an
<i lang="es">oidor</i> in matters of government. The desire to
interfere does not seem to have been confined to one individual, but
was apparently characteristic of all the magistrates of the
audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3098src" href="#xd21e3098" name=
"xd21e3098src">29</a></p>
<p>The extensive field over which the <i lang="es">oidores</i> claimed
cognizance is shown by a series of memorials which were sent by the
audiencia as a body to the court under the date of June 26,
1586.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3106src" href="#xd21e3106" name=
"xd21e3106src">30</a> They are noted here because they illustrate the
diversity of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>interests of the <i lang="es">oidores</i>, and
because their devotion to these various matters was characterized as
unjustified meddling by the governor and the other opponents of the
audiencia. The concern which the <i lang="es">oidores</i> manifested in
the miscellaneous affairs of government constituted, no doubt, an
indirect reason for the temporary removal of the tribunal in 1589.</p>
<p>These memorials suggested reform in many departments of government.
The inadequate state of defense and the demoralized condition into
which the garrison had fallen was the subject of one letter. Attention
was called to the necessity of obtaining more funds for the
fortifications of the Islands. Reference was made to the continual
danger of Japanese invasion. Another letter dealt with financial
affairs. The public exchequer was reported to be in bad condition, as
there was not enough money in the treasury to pay the expenses of
government. The <i lang="es">oidores</i> recommended that their own
salaries should be paid out of the treasury of Mexico. They suggested
an increase of tribute as a means of securing more money. This, they
alleged, could be done in justice, since the amount of tribute paid by
the natives of the Philippines did not equal that levied upon the
Indians of New Spain.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3122src" href=
"#xd21e3122" name="xd21e3122src">31</a> The <i lang="es">oidores</i>
reported an increase of 5000 <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href=
"#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>pesos in the revenues of the colony
as profits from the sale of certain offices which had formerly been
bestowed gratis by the governor upon his friends, the righting of this
wrong being effected through the influence of the <i lang=
"es">fiscal</i> and <i lang="es">oidores</i> who officiated as members
of the <i lang="es">junta de hacienda</i>.</p>
<p>While ostensibly seeking means for the enlargement of the income of
the Islands, as noted, the <i lang="es">oidores</i> protested against a
recent royal order which had required that the proceeds returned from
vacant <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> should be placed in the public
treasury. They objected that this would take away all hope of reward
from soldiers and subjects &ldquo;who have served your Majesty,
reducing them to poverty, with no means of support <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>after a
long career of service.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3304src"
href="#xd21e3304" name="xd21e3304src">32</a> In other words, the
audiencia is here seen registering its objections to the conversion of
private into royal <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>, notwithstanding the
fact that this would mean greater revenue for the government. The
inconsistency of this attitude was pointed out by Magistrate
D&aacute;valos in his letter of June 20, 1585.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3311src" href="#xd21e3311" name="xd21e3311src">33</a></p>
<p>Another petition which may reflect some discredit upon the audiencia
was one which asked for the abolition of the one and one-half per cent
tax on imported money, and for the elimination of the three per cent
<i lang="es">almojarifazgo</i>. Both of these taxes bore heavily on the
Chinese and on the Spanish merchants of Manila. &ldquo;These two
taxes,&rdquo; wrote the <i lang="es">oidores</i>, &ldquo;are drawing
the life-blood from the Chinese, who would otherwise bring products of
great value to our shores.&rdquo; The <i lang="es">oidores</i> had
commenced this memorial by showing the financial needs of the colony.
They had requested assistance from the treasury of Mexico, yet, in the
same communication, they proposed to abolish three of the most
profitable sources of colonial revenue that existed. These
recommendations not only illustrate the wide sphere of influence of the
magistrates, but they also seem to confirm the allegations which were
often brought against them, charges, indeed, which they proffered
against one another&mdash;that each was more interested in trade than
in the welfare <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>of the government. Notwithstanding the fact that
the economic life of the colony depended on the Chinese trade, the
evidence seems to indicate that, even this early in the history of the
tribunal, its magistrates had personal interests to serve. In the
letter referred to above, D&aacute;valos, who seems to have been a
dissenting party to all these proceedings, charged his contemporaries
with being guilty of undue mercantile activity.</p>
<p>In this same memorial the <i lang="es">oidores</i> warned the
Council against the Portuguese influence in China, deploring the
existence of Macao as a rival to Manila as a trade emporium in the
Orient. The audiencia warned the court against the influence and
operations of Pedro Unaman&uacute;, the successor to Captain Gali, who
had gone to China and Macao, supposedly to take on a cargo of Chinese
silks. This was in defiance of the law which forbade Spaniards to trade
in China, and it was also contrary to the instructions of the viceroy
and audiencia of New Spain. In this connection the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> stated that they had recommended to Governor Santiago
de Vera that Unaman&uacute; should be arrested and punished for
diverting his voyage in the interests of private trade. In accordance
with the advice of the tribunal the governor had sent orders to Macao,
summoning the leader of this expedition back to Manila; these
instructions, however, the governor of Macao was unable to
fulfill.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3336src" href="#xd21e3336" name=
"xd21e3336src">34</a></p>
<p>This memorial shows that the <i lang="es">oidores</i> considered it
to be their duty to inform the court fully as to the part which the
audiencia played in this affair. The matter at hand constituted a
question of disobedience of the law, and the Audiencia of Manila had
done what it could to enforce it. The tribunal had assumed a role quite
as important as that of the governor. The episode shows also that the
audiencia was consulted by the governor in this matter, which was
purely governmental. It would not be unfair to suggest that a potential
factor in stimulating the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href=
"#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span><i lang="es">oidores</i> and
merchants of Manila to prevent the voyage of Pedro Unaman&uacute; or
the Portuguese to China for trading purposes must have been the desire
to safeguard the Spanish interests in the Chinese trade, and
particularly those of Manila, which were the sole reliance of the
colony. It was essential that this commerce should be prevented from
falling into the hands of other individuals or nations.</p>
<p>This memorial also dealt with ecclesiastical affairs. In it was set
forth the audiencia&rsquo;s arguments in certain contentions which the
tribunal had had with the bishop, illustrating the fact that the
audiencia was opposed not only by the governor but also by the
ecclesiastical authorities. It appears that the king had formerly
granted to the church courts a large share of temporal jurisdiction in
the Islands. This former concession now stood in the way of the royal
prerogative and caused endless conflicts between the civil and
ecclesiastical judges. The audiencia took the ground that by virtue of
its own establishment the authority of the church courts over civil
matters was at an end. This the prelate declined to admit. Attention
was also directed by the audiencia to the opposition which Bishop
Salazar had manifested toward the claims advanced by the civil
government for extending its jurisdiction over all the non-Christian
tribes, the bishop alleging that Pope Alexander VI had ceded authority
only over such Indians as had been christianized.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3350src" href="#xd21e3350" name="xd21e3350src">35</a></p>
<p>In truth, the bishop had found after two years of conflict that the
presence of the audiencia had not entirely solved the problems of
administration, but, on the contrary, had increased the complexity of
many of them. He had differed seriously with the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> on several occasions. The ministers had opposed him
not only in the larger questions of government and ecclesiastical
administration, but in matters of ceremony as well. This <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>was more
than the prelate could endure. He appealed some of these disputes to
the governor and that official, after having neglected these matters
for a long period, finally referred them to the audiencia, which
promptly made the settlements in its own favor.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3363src" href="#xd21e3363" name="xd21e3363src">36</a></p>
<p>Salazar&rsquo;s influence went far toward bringing about the removal
of the tribunal, as it had helped in causing its establishment in 1584.
The complaints of the bishop against the audiencia brought forth a
royal reprimand for carrying on continual disputes with the audiencia.
The prelate defended himself against these charges in a memorial dated
June 24, 1590.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3368src" href="#xd21e3368"
name="xd21e3368src">37</a> He stated that these petty matters of form
and ceremony were of no great consequence. He accused the governor of
seeking to stir up discord between him and the audiencia. As a matter
of fact, he said, the relations between him and the audiencia were far
more harmonious than they had been between the tribunal and the
governor, and on many occasions he had been called in to settle
disputes between the functionaries of the civil government. &ldquo;It
is well known,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;within the city and outside of
it, that had I not entered as mediator between the president and
<i lang="es">oidores</i> there would have been no peace. It would not
have been possible for me to mediate if there had not been friendly
relations between them and me.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3374src" href="#xd21e3374" name="xd21e3374src">38</a></p>
<p>The unpopularity of the audiencia from 1584 to 1586 is proved by the
fact that practically all the authorities in Manila&mdash;mercantile,
ecclesiastical, political, and even the magistrates
themselves&mdash;united in recommending its recall. On June 26, 1586, a
series of petitions was directed to the Council from various personages
and organizations of the city asking that the audiencia be removed.
These included the municipal <i lang="es">cabildo</i>, the bishop, the
governor, certain military officials, and, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>lastly,
several <i lang="es">oidores</i> (all, in fact, excepting
D&aacute;valos). These greatly regretted the mistake which had been
made in the establishment of the audiencia, conceded that it had been a
failure, and represented that the financial burden which its presence
had imposed had been too great for the colony to bear.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3388src" href="#xd21e3388" name=
"xd21e3388src">39</a> It is certain that the continual conflicts which
had resulted from the presence of the audiencia had not produced a
salutary effect on the government.</p>
<p>The audiencia itself wrote to the Council at the same time:
&ldquo;There has been in this tribunal, between the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> and the president, continual misunderstandings as to
jurisdiction, which we have decided to submit to your Majesty to
ascertain whether precedence in these matters belongs to the president
or to the <i lang="es">oidores</i>.&rdquo; The Manila <i lang=
"es">cabildo</i> recommended the re-establishment of the governorship
with centralized authority: the power to grant titles, offices and
<i lang="es">encomiendas</i>, with exclusive authority over the latter.
This would include the power of appointing <i lang=
"es">encomenderos</i> in the name of the king. The recommendation was
made by the <i lang="es">cabildo</i> that consultative authority in
matters of government should be conferred on the ecclesiastical and
military officials. It was also suggested that a defender of the
Indians should be appointed other than the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, for
the latter, by nature of his office, was their prosecutor rather than
their defender. It was the current opinion, this memorial went on to
state, that the local prelate should be restored to his former place as
defender of the Indians, and that he should have authority to
dispossess <i lang="es">encomenderos</i>, if necessity for such action
arose.</p>
<p>It has already been stated that Oidor D&aacute;valos was the only
official of importance who would not join in these representations. He
believed that the audiencia was necessary to the prosperity of the
colony, and that, if properly controlled, it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>would
prove beneficial. He believed, moreover, that the governor was the
chief element of discord in the colony, and that his influence had
rendered inefficacious the efforts of the audiencia to keep peace and
to enforce the laws. In a letter to the king,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3422src" href="#xd21e3422" name="xd21e3422src">40</a> just a year
before the memorial described above, D&aacute;valos had represented
Governor Santiago de Vera as a schemer, aiming to get absolute control
of the government. De Vera, he said, had gone so far as to influence
the bishop and clergy to recommend, against their better judgment, the
abolition of the audiencia. The governor realized that the tribunal was
the one obstacle in the way of the fulfillment of his designs and had
used every possible means to discredit and humiliate the audiencia and
its magistrates. D&aacute;valos asserted that the appeal of cases to
Mexico would inflict great inconvenience on the people of Manila. He
renewed the argument that Spain should have some sovereign body at that
great distance from the mother country. He enlarged on the future
possibilities of the conquest and rule of the entire Orient by Spain,
pointing out the value of the Philippines as a base of operations. It
was, therefore, of the greatest importance that the Islands should be
provided with the proper sort of government.</p>
<p>D&aacute;valos was especially bitter in his denunciation of Governor
De Vera, who, he said, had even resorted to force in order to
intimidate the magistrates and had called a council of military
officials on one occasion for consultation in matters of justice and
government. The governor was accused of violating the laws which had
forbidden officials to hold <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>; he had given
the best posts in the government to relatives, and had completely set
aside the judgments which D&aacute;valos had rendered in his capacity
as <i lang="es">juez y administrador de bienes de difuntos</i>. The
audiencia had been powerless to oppose De Vera, largely, D&aacute;valos
inferred, because a majority of the magistrates were under his
influence. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span></p>
<p>However unfavorable were the above comments on the governor, the
picture which De Vera drew of himself in a letter to Archbishop
Contreras,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3436src" href="#xd21e3436" name=
"xd21e3436src">41</a> at that time viceroy of New Spain, is exceedingly
interesting by way of contrast. In his own words, the governor had
grown &ldquo;old and worn&rdquo; in his Majesty&rsquo;s service.
According to him, the audiencia was of no service to the government,
and only a drawback, making his own duties as governor doubly heavy,
especially &ldquo;since the Council [of the Indias] so poorly seconds
my efforts ... everything concerning the government and war in these
islands depends on the president. He must attend to everything
punctually; and, in order to comply with his Majesty&rsquo;s commands,
he must pay over and spend from the royal treasury what is necessary
for the affairs of government and of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He complained that the audiencia had interfered with his
administration of the finances and had suspended the payment of the
drafts which he had drawn on the treasury. He had no recourse on
account of the delay necessary before an appeal to the Council of the
Indies could be answered. He complained that the audiencia had meddled
with affairs of government on trivial pretexts, rendering him
practically powerless.</p>
<p>During this period the internal troubles of the colony were
supplemented by the interference of the viceroy and audiencia in
Mexico. The latter had been reluctant to surrender their former
authority over the Philippines. There were conflicts of jurisdiction
between the viceroy and the governor and between the two audiencias
over a number of matters, among which affairs of a commercial nature
were pre&euml;minent. Both the authorities at Manila and those of
Mexico claimed jurisdiction over the galleons which plied between
Manila and Acapulco.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3444src" href=
"#xd21e3444" name="xd21e3444src">42</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>Numerous protests were
made during this early period against what was considered the
unauthorized interference of the Mexican authorities. Those in Manila
felt that inasmuch as they had an audiencia which was co-equal in power
with that of New Spain, they should be independent of the viceroyalty
in all the affairs of justice, government, and commerce.</p>
<p>The combined memorials of the residents and officials of Manila,
which we have already noted, were presented at court by a new
procurator, Fray Alonso S&aacute;nchez. The latter, a Jesuit, was a
churchman of high standing, and his abilities were recognized both at
Madrid and in Rome. Besides carrying commissions from the secular
officials, he represented the bishop, but the latter, distrustful of
the influence at court of a Jesuit commissioned by the secular
government, with which the prelate was constantly at war, determined to
send one of his own supporters to Spain to represent his interests. The
emissary of Salazar was Fray Francisco Ortega, of the Augustinian
order. Ortega followed S&aacute;nchez to Spain and rendered valuable
service as procurator of his order at Madrid.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3462src" href="#xd21e3462" name="xd21e3462src">43</a></p>
<p>In written memorials and in personal interviews with the king and
with members of the Council of the Indies, S&aacute;nchez summarized
all the arguments heretofore given, asking for the abolition of the
audiencia. The newness of the country, the sparseness of the population
and the poverty of the inhabitants, according to his argument, made
such an institution a financial burden. If it were continued, the
salaries of the magistrates would have to be paid from Mexico. An
audiencia in Manila was not necessary, he urged, since the chief
element of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>population was military, and hence under martial
law and jurisdiction. Even before the establishment of the audiencia it
had been necessary to send but few cases to Mexico; indeed, alleged
S&aacute;nchez, lawsuits seldom arose in the colony, and the presence
of the audiencia encouraged rather than prevented litigation among the
few merchants who lived in Manila. The discord caused by the presence
of the tribunal and the continual lawsuits which it encouraged among
the Spaniards had a disquieting effect on the natives, who had no need
of such an institution, and who did not even understand its purposes.
The audiencia, instead of serving as a protection to the natives, was
an instrument of tyranny. The Spaniards, understanding the use of a
court which would enforce the contracts made between them and the
ignorant Indians, were often supported in the seizure of the
latter&rsquo;s property, which act, in reality, amounted to deprivation
and legalized robbery. S&aacute;nchez stated that the natives had been
terrorized by the audiencia. The magistrates, versed in the legal
customs and practices of Spain rather than of the Indians, were unfit
to administer justice in the Philippines.</p>
<p>S&aacute;nchez also emphasized the international phases of the
audiencia&rsquo;s existence in the Philippines, though with conclusions
slightly different from those which we have already noted. He stated
that the presence of the audiencia had caused the Portuguese, in China,
formerly friendly, to be distrustful of the Spaniards, and this had
resulted in a considerable diminution of trade. This change of attitude
he attributed to the wording of the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> by
which the tribunal had been created, extending its jurisdiction
throughout the &ldquo;entire archipelago of China.&rdquo;
S&aacute;nchez concluded his appeal with the statement that some act
was necessary to restore the confidence of the Portuguese, whose
influence, exerted upon the Chinese, could spell ruin for Spain&rsquo;s
Far Eastern colony. The cancellation of that claim to China would
remove all evidence of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70"
name="pb70">70</a>]</span>Spanish bad faith; it would show to the
Portuguese that the Spaniards had no desire to encroach on their
rights, and through the restoration of commerce and prosperity the
future of the colony would be assured.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3482src" href="#xd21e3482" name="xd21e3482src">44</a></p>
<p>Sufficient has been presented to show that the audiencia, as
established in 1584, was not a success. The chief objection to the
tribunal was not its influence as a court; the real fault seems to have
lain in the indefiniteness of the articles of establishment which gave
it administrative powers, co-ordinate with the governor and
captain-general. Almost every difficulty occurred in the administrative
field. The audiencia also failed to preserve harmony between church and
state and added to these complexities by itself having dissensions with
the bishop. The petty character of the men who constituted this
particular government, their personal selfishness, and their eagerness
to take advantage, in dishonest ways, of the time and the distance
which separated the colony from the royal control, contributed to the
failure of the institution at that time. The audiencia was scarcely
established, and it certainly did not have time to adjust itself to the
new conditions with which it found itself surrounded, before it was
removed. It would seem that the authorities in Madrid were somewhat
hasty in withdrawing the audiencia, for it had proved its efficacy
throughout the entire Spanish empire. The ill success of the Audiencia
of Manila at this time does not prove that the institution was a
failure, or that its establishment was a mistake, for seven years later
it was returned and continued <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href=
"#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>without interruption until 1898, and
continues still as then reorganized. The statement of Philip II on
November 25, 1595, &ldquo;that experience had proved it to be
unnecessary in a land so new and unsettled&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3497src" href="#xd21e3497" name="xd21e3497src">45</a> can hardly
be justified in view of subsequent events.</p>
<p>The causes of the breakdown of the first audiencia may be found in
the circumstances of the time, the personnel of the tribunal, the
indefiniteness of the laws which created it, the novelty of the
situation to magistrates and officials and their failure to adapt
themselves to their duties and to one another. As an institution of
reform the audiencia did not have time to adjust itself to a permanent
status.</p>
<p>The king, in compliance with the demands of the various
organizations and individuals of Manila as communicated by their
respective envoys, abolished the Audiencia of Manila by royal <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> on August 9, 1589, ordering the Viceroy of New
Spain to take the <i lang="es">residencias</i> of all officials who had
been identified with the Manila government. To carry out these orders
Licentiate Herver del Coral was sent from Mexico to Manila, where he
arrived in May, 1590, in company with the new governor, G&oacute;mez
P&eacute;rez Dasmari&ntilde;as.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3513src"
href="#xd21e3513" name="xd21e3513src">46</a> Santiago de Vera, the
ex-governor, was promoted to a magistracy in the Audiencia of Mexico;
the <i lang="es">oidor</i>, Pedro de Rojas, was made <i lang=
"es">teniente</i> and <i lang="es">asesor</i> to the governor, while
the former <i lang="es">oidor</i>, Rivera, and Fiscal Ayala, were left
without office.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3529src" href="#xd21e3529"
name="xd21e3529src">47</a></p>
<p>The regular organization for the administration of justice in the
provinces was left precisely as it had been when the tribunal was in
existence. The <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> and the <i lang=
"es">corregidores</i> still functioned as judges of first instance and
as governors of the provinces. The <i lang="es">alcaldes ordinarios</i>
remained the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>judges of first instance in the city of Manila.
These judges tried cases with appeal to the governor, and the judgment
of the latter was final in cases involving a value of a thousand ducats
or less. Cases of a higher category might be appealed from the decision
of the governor to the Audiencia of Mexico, and thence, if again
appealed, to the Council of the Indies.</p>
<p>The audiencia of three magistrates and a <i lang="es">fiscal</i> was
replaced by a governor, who was both captain-general and sole judge. He
was assisted in the latter capacity, as above noted, by a <i lang=
"es">teniente</i> and <i lang="es">asesor</i>, a lawyer, who advised
him in legal affairs and prepared his judicial decisions for him. This
reform was made on the representation of Fray S&aacute;nchez, that
Manila had no need of a judicial system more pretentious than that of
any Spanish provincial town. That city was accordingly reduced to the
rank of a city or district, with dependence in judicial and
administrative matters on New Spain, in whose audiencia appeals from
the governor of the Philippines were heard.</p>
<p>With these new reforms the leading authorities in Manila professed
to be greatly pleased. Bishop Salazar, who was the most influential
person in Manila at this time, expressed his satisfaction to the king
in a letter dated June 24, 1590.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3561src"
href="#xd21e3561" name="xd21e3561src">48</a> He suggested, however,
that the continuance of the audiencia might have been satisfactory
could its members have been paid from the treasury of New Spain. He
reported the arrival of the new governor, and stated that the latter
had already given evidence of a desire to govern wisely and justly.</p>
<p>Salazar&rsquo;s optimism in regard to the good intentions of the
governor could not have been long continued, for Morga tells us that in
the first year of the government of G&oacute;mez P&eacute;rez
Dasmari&ntilde;as the need of an audiencia was felt by many.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3566src" href="#xd21e3566" name=
"xd21e3566src">49</a> At that time, all the powers of government were
centralized in the governor, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href=
"#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>and there was no immediate authority
to which the people could apply for relief. Salazar had many disputes
with the governor over questions relating to the respective spheres of
the church and state, and from the decisions of the executive the
prelate had no recourse. Dasmari&ntilde;as, on reporting these matters
to the king, stated that the bishop had interfered in the matter of the
collection of the tribute, the government of the <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i>, the Chinese trade (in which, the governor alleged
that the prelate had an unpriestly interest), and in the administration
of justice.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3574src" href="#xd21e3574" name=
"xd21e3574src">50</a> The prelate had interpreted the removal of the
audiencia as constituting a re-establishment of the concession formerly
made to the church of extensive control in the administration of
government and justice. He claimed that ecclesiastical judges should
have the same civil jurisdiction as they had exercised before the
audiencia was first founded. This, of course, the governor would not
tolerate.</p>
<p>Bishop Salazar was so displeased with the turn which affairs had
taken in Manila that he determined to leave the Islands, and passage
being placed at his disposal by the willing governor, the bishop set
out in July, 1592.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3583src" href=
"#xd21e3583" name="xd21e3583src">51</a> On his arrival in Spain,
Salazar concerned himself principally with religious matters, securing
some valuable reforms. Among the latter was the erection of the
Philippines into an archbishopric and the creation of three subordinate
bishoprics. Salazar showed the desirability of the restoration of the
audiencia as a preventive check on the excesses of the governor, but
this change was not made as an immediate consequence of his
recommendations.</p>
<p>A <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> was issued on January 17, 1593,
which outlined with more definiteness a judicial system for the
Islands. This <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>reform confirmed the position of the governor as
nominal head of the judiciary, with jurisdiction over appeals from the
lower courts, but it decreed that these cases should be tried by a
<i lang="es">letrado</i>. The governor&rsquo;s final and conclusive
jurisdiction was extended to all cases not exceeding a thousand ducats
in value. Cases of a greater value might be appealed to the Audiencia
of Mexico.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3596src" href="#xd21e3596" name=
"xd21e3596src">52</a> The governor was given authority to name a
protector of the Indians.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3601src" href=
"#xd21e3601" name="xd21e3601src">53</a></p>
<p>The above changes were followed shortly by the <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> of August 18, 1593, by which the title of
<i lang="es">teniente de capit&aacute;n-general y asesor de gobernador
y capit&aacute;n-general de las Islas Filipinas</i> was bestowed on Don
Antonio de Morga, who was probably the most efficient jurist and one of
the most versatile officials that Spain ever sent to her Asiatic
dependency.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3620src" href="#xd21e3620" name=
"xd21e3620src">54</a> Morga was at this time not only successor to the
audiencia in judicial matters, but also attorney-general and sole legal
adviser to the governor. His predecessor, Pedro de Rojas, was
transferred to Mexico, in pursuance of the idea, as alleged in the
order of transfer, of removing from the Philippines all the members of
the old audiencia, so that the new scheme, as revised at that time,
might be allowed to work itself out without prejudice. Before his
departure, the <i lang="es">residencia</i> of Rojas was conducted by
Morga.</p>
<p>Even the reforms of 1593 did not suffice to make the administration
of justice satisfactory to all parties. From the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>large
amount of correspondence which exists, embodying complaints against the
harsh methods of Dasmari&ntilde;as and his successor, Tello, three
letters may be cited which show the attitude of the various officials
of the colony towards the re-establishment of the audiencia. The first
of these was written by Governor Dasmari&ntilde;as himself, and it may
be in some ways surprising to note that he asked for the restoration of
the audiencia. His reasons, in part, however, were different from those
advanced by his contemporaries. Dasmari&ntilde;as was of the opinion
that an audiencia would be effective in the nullification of the
interdicts and excommunications imposed by the archbishop and the local
prelates, which he claimed were working havoc with the civil
government.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3633src" href="#xd21e3633" name=
"xd21e3633src">55</a></p>
<p>The treasury officials complained that the absolute government of
the executive was contrary to the interests of <i lang="es">real
hacienda</i>. Their objections to the prevailing system were voiced in
the second of the memorials alluded to above, that of Francisco de la
Misa, <i lang="es">factor</i> of the royal treasury of Manila.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3644src" href="#xd21e3644" name=
"xd21e3644src">56</a> Misa said that under the former arrangement the
audiencia had audited the accounts of the royal treasury and of the
city of Manila each year. In this way the accounts had been well kept
and the funds properly accounted for. The removal of the audiencia had
left the governor with authority over the nomination of the officials
of <i lang="es">real hacienda</i>, as well as the supervision of the
accounts. Since Dasmari&ntilde;as had been governor, no accounts had
been rendered by the minor officials of the treasury, and, as a
consequence, their superiors had been unable to make up their reports
for the Contadur&iacute;a of Mexico. The governor&rsquo;s attention had
been called to this deficiency repeatedly, but the latter had displayed
no interest in the state of the colony&rsquo;s finances, which, said
Misa, exceeded all other matters in importance. &ldquo;This
comes,&rdquo; the <i lang="es">factor</i> observed, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>&ldquo;from placing in charge of Your
Majesty&rsquo;s finances a soldier, unfitted to do else than command
troops, and then unchecked by an audiencia, so far distant from your
royal person.&rdquo; The laxity of the governor and of his subordinates
seems to have resulted in the loss of much revenue.</p>
<p>Misa also showed that there had been many irregularities in the sale
of offices, deficiencies which the presence of an audiencia would have
checked. Instead of selling the minor clerkships of the exchequer, the
governor had given them to his friends. Two offices, which were by no
means insignificant, those of the chief clerkships of government and of
justice, respectively, had been sold formerly for four thousand pesos
each. The governor, however, had preferred to have them on his civil
patronage list; this would not have been permitted had an audiencia
been present to enforce the law.</p>
<p>The governor was charged by Misa with extravagance in the
expenditure of the revenue of the colony. The payment of the salaries
of new appointees to offices, friends of the governor, had made heavy
drains on the treasury. The king, by repeated <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dulas</i>, had forbidden the designation of an excessive
number of <i lang="es">alcaldes</i> and <i lang="es">corregidores</i>
because of the desirability of economizing the resources of the colony.
While the audiencia was in existence its consent had been necessary for
the creation of new judicial districts, but since the recall of the
tribunal, the governor had trebled the number of provincial officials,
and, in addition, had permitted each to have a salaried assistant.</p>
<p>According to Misa, various other evils had resulted from the
absolutism of the governor, among which were numerous abuses which he
had tolerated in the galleon trade. It was alleged that Spanish
merchants in Mexico had sent money to agents in Manila, and in that way
had caused the legal amount brought from Acapulco for investment on the
annual galleon to be exceeded.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3671src"
href="#xd21e3671" name="xd21e3671src">57</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>This,
the <i lang="es">factor</i> stated, was due partially to the laxity and
corruption of the Acapulco officials, who had permitted the galleon to
leave that port with more than the authorized amount of money. The
governor of the Philippines, however, could have prevented this abuse
had he been so inclined, as the ships&rsquo; manifests were always
subject to his inspection on arrival at Manila. The money sent by the
merchants of Mexico was invested in merchandise in the Islands and
these goods were shipped back to Acapulco on the galleon, thus
excluding the commerce of the local merchants. The latter were growing
poorer daily while the governor and his friends were waxing richer. The
governor had also exercised favoritism in the distribution of cargo
space, thus rewarding his friends and punishing his enemies.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3693src" href="#xd21e3693" name=
"xd21e3693src">58</a> Since the suppression of the audiencia these
abuses had increased, as there had been no authority in Manila to hold
the governor in check.</p>
<p>This memorial, from Misa, which was carefully considered at court,
went far toward demonstrating that the restoration of the audiencia
would have beneficial results, so far as the administration of <i lang=
"es">real hacienda</i> was concerned.</p>
<p>The third of the letters referred to as reflecting the attitude of
the Manila officials toward the re-establishment of the audiencia and
ultimately contributing to its restoration, was directed to the court
by Antonio de Morga, the efficient lieutenant-governor. Morga, as did
Misa, placed great emphasis on the need in Manila of a more efficient
system for the administration of the exchequer. Morga was moderate in
his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>characterization of the governor, alleging that
Dasmari&ntilde;as had been brought completely under the influence of
the ecclesiastics. He expressed the belief that an audiencia would aid
in combatting what he termed the retrogression of the colony under the
influence of the priests. &ldquo;There should be someone,&rdquo; he
wrote, &ldquo;to oppose the ecclesiastics in a land so far away from
the Audiencia of Mexico; for, no matter what question is sent there for
decision, at least two years must elapse before despatches can be
returned.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3710src" href="#xd21e3710"
name="xd21e3710src">59</a> No official was better qualified to explain
the needs of the colony in matters of justice than Morga, for he was at
that time, in reality, the supreme court of the Islands.</p>
<p>The audiencia, after an interregnum of seven years, was restored by
a <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> promulgated by Philip II, November 26,
1595.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3718src" href="#xd21e3718" name=
"xd21e3718src">60</a> The tribunal was to consist of a president, who
should also be governor and captain-general, four <i lang=
"es">oidores</i>, a <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, and various subordinates.
The history of the former audiencia and the reasons for its suppression
and re-establishment are summarized in the <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">I established an audiencia in that city and province
in order that everything might be governed by means of it, and that
justice might be administered with the same universal equality,
mildness, and satisfaction desirable; after its establishment I ordered
it suppressed as experience proved it unnecessary in a land so new and
unsettled; in its place I sent a governor, and though his
administration was excellent, yet, inasmuch as that community had
grown, and I hope that it will continue to grow, I have thought it
advisable to found and establish the said audiencia again.</p>
</div>
<p>In this <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i>, which was addressed to
Governor Tello, the king pointed to the increased importance of the
Philippines, and to the many expeditions by which the Island of
Luz&oacute;n and other islands of the Archipelago had become pacified
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>more densely settled. The increase of commerce
with the Chinese was also cited as a reason for providing the Islands
with a more stable government. It was stated that in the administration
of justice there should be as much efficiency as possible without the
loss and inconvenience involved in appealing cases to Mexico. The
governor would have more time for his increasing administrative and
military duties if disengaged from his former judicial functions. The
<i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> continued:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">You [the governor] may find it advisable to have by
you persons with whom to take counsel, in order that matters may be
considered with the requisite conformity and by a sufficiently large
body of advisers; for these reasons I have decided to form an
audiencia; ... you shall be its president, holding that office with
those of my governor and captain-general.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3749src" href="#xd21e3749" name="xd21e3749src">61</a></p>
</div>
<p>Together with this decree of re-establishment the king issued
special instructions to Tello, prescribing in detail the relations
which the governor was to observe with the audiencia. These
instructions, in general, sought to prevent the recurrence of the
misunderstandings which had been so fatal to the earlier tribunal. The
governor and <i lang="es">oidores</i> were ordered to co-operate in the
formulation of commercial regulations, with a view, particularly, to
securing the Chinese trade, in the enforcement <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>of the
<i lang="es">pancada</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3768src" href=
"#xd21e3768" name="xd21e3768src">62</a> the consideration of ways and
means to prevent money from passing to China, in matters of taxation
and finance, <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>, and the pacification and
government of the wild tribes. By these instructions, it is important
to note, the function of advising the governor in administrative
matters was definitely bestowed upon the <i lang="es">oidores</i>.
&ldquo;Matters of importance,&rdquo; the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i>
prescribed, &ldquo;the said president-governor shall discuss with the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> of the said audiencia, so that the latter,
after consultation, may give him their opinion.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3795src" href="#xd21e3795" name=
"xd21e3795src">63</a></p>
<p>The governor and the magistrates were jointly charged to do all
possible to discourage Indians and Spaniards from wasting their means
in fruitless and petty lawsuits. The natives, according to this new
<i lang="es">reglamento</i>, should always be protected against the
designs of those who would take undue advantage of them. The governor
was moreover instructed to confer with the archbishop and audiencia in
ecclesiastical affairs, and the prelates were especially forbidden to
excommunicate and issue declamations from the pulpit against the
officials of the civil government, such as were constantly proclaimed
when Salazar was bishop. Priests were not to meddle with the civil
government, or with the <i lang="es">pancada</i>, or with any form of
trade.</p>
<p>The audiencia as reformed, with the powers and duties noted, began
its life in Manila on May 8, 1598. The inauguration <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>of the
tribunal was attended with general rejoicing, and a celebration
characterized by great formality and pomp. The royal seal was conducted
through the city in a procession which was composed of all the royal
and clerical dignitaries. Church, state, and citizenry united in
expressing satisfaction at the restoration of the tribunal, with its
consequent prospect of an efficient government and administration of
justice.</p>
<p>Reforms were made in the scope and composition of the audiencia at
various times during its existence. It developed from a commission of
three magistrates, with a president at its head, with definite and
ill-expressed powers over a vast archipelago, whose population was
sparse and scattered, to a double-chambered tribunal of appeal in
second and third instance, with definite jurisdiction over a
well-organized commonwealth. It would be highly desirable, did space
allow, to review chronologically the important reforms which were made
in the organization, scope and jurisdiction of the Audiencia of Manila
throughout its history. The most important of these, however, will be
noted incidentally in the following pages.</p>
<p>The audiencia, from the time of its renewal onward, typified and
represented the royal authority, and its tenure was more continuous
than the governorship. Eight times subsequently did the audiencia
assume the reins of government in lieu of the governor. It became the
most reliable channel through which the royal authority made itself
felt in the Islands, and it was especially utilized by the court as a
check on the governor.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3822src" href=
"#xd21e3822" name="xd21e3822src">64</a> Whenever occasion arose, the
audiencia interposed as the intermediary and arbiter between dissenting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>parties in the name of the sovereign, and its
decrees were listened to with respect. It was no longer a temporary
organization, and so firmly established was it henceforth that no
person seriously considered its recall a possibility. Through a period
of three hundred years the audiencia exercised its functions. It was
first and always a judicial body. It shared executive and
administrative duties with the governor. It frequently exercised
attributes of an advanced legislative character. It participated in the
government of the provinces. It shared the authority of the royal
patronage in the control of ecclesiastical affairs. These various
activities will be studied in subsequent chapters. <span class=

first <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> in the Philippines were granted by
Legaspi in 1572 (Montero y Vidal, <i lang="es">Historia general,</i> I,
42&ndash;43). The <i lang="es">encomenderos</i> ruled the Indians in
their care with little interference from <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores,
corregidores,</i> or governors. Vander Linden especially emphasizes the
fact that the <i lang="es">encomenderos</i> were not supposed to act as
the private masters of the Indians on their holdings, but were to act
as the representatives of the king (Vander Linden, <i lang=
"fr">L&rsquo;expansion coloniale de l&rsquo;Espagne,</i>
345&ndash;346). The laws of the Indies specified that the <i lang=
"es">encomenderos</i> were to protect, aid and educate them, seeing
particularly that they were taught the Catholic Faith (<i lang=
"es">Recopilaci&oacute;n,</i> 6&ndash;8, 9, 10, 11; esp. tit. 9, laws
1&ndash;4).</p>
<p class="footnote">The <i lang="es">encomenderos,</i> in the guise of
benefactors, guardians and protectors of the Indians, supervised the
labor of the latter on the <i lang="es">encomiendas,</i> drawing
remuneration therefrom, collecting tribute from them, and retaining a
share of that. Aside from the very intimate relationship of the
<i lang="es">encomenderos</i> as the guardians of the Indians in
spiritual and temporal things, they were not considered as officials in
the same sense as were the <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> and
<i lang="es">corregidores.</i></p>
<p class="footnote">Dr. Pardo de Tavera characterizes the duties and
relations of the <i lang="es">encomenderos</i> to the Indians as
follows: &ldquo;The encomenderos were the first Spaniards after the
conquest and pacification of the colony who represented the civil
authority of Spain in the Islands: they were obliged to maintain order
and secure the well-being of the Indian residents of their encomiendas
or holdings, and to defend their tenants against any encroachments on
their rights by the Spaniards, soldiers, alcaldes, and judges; and to
endeavor to bring their tenants together in towns and furnish them with
opportunities to be converted to the Christian religion, and to help
them build churches and convents ... encomenderos were charged with the
succor and support of the people on their holdings in case of any
calamity, famine or public disaster, and they were prohibited from
charging tribute in bulk against the various barangayes, that is to
say, they should not make the chiefs of a family or tribe responsible
for the payment of tribute by the various members, nor were the
<i lang="es">encomenderos</i> allowed to use force to secure the
payment of a tribute. When an <i lang="es">encomendero</i> received a
tribute from his people, he thereupon was considered to have assumed
the duty of acting as their protector&rdquo; (Pardo de Tavera,
<i>Philippines census</i> [1905], I, 330). Suffice it to say that,
theoretically, the <i lang="es">encomenderos</i> were the fatherly
protectors and benefactors of the helpless, childlike natives, and
their every act was to be for the good of their wards.</p>

<i lang="es">Relaci&oacute;n</i> of Migu&eacute;l de Loarca, <i lang=
"es">alcalde mayor</i> of Ar&eacute;valo, Panay, gives us a good idea
of the rapidity with which this institution spread within ten years in
the Philippines. It indicates the extent to which the <i lang=
"es">encomienda</i> was utilized as a means of opening up and settling
the country. This report is dated June 12, 1582. At that time there
were three principal centers of administration in the Islands: Manila,
Ceb&uacute; and Ar&eacute;valo. About thirty <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i> were located close to Manila, ten were near to
Ceb&uacute;, and fifteen near to Ar&eacute;valo under the jurisdiction
of Loarca. The latter group consisted of about 20,000 Indians. <i lang=
"es">Encomiendas</i> varied in size from 250 to 1500 natives, but the
ideal <i lang="es">encomienda</i> was supposed to contain 500 souls. By
<i lang="es">c&eacute;dula,</i> of August 9, 1589, royal authority was
extended for the increase of the size of <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>
in the Philippines to 800 or 1000 persons, if necessary, in order to
bear the greater expenses of instruction and defense. This was bitterly
opposed by the churchmen on account of the additional missionary labors
incumbent on the priests assigned to these larger <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i> (<i lang="es">C&eacute;dula</i> of August 9, 1589,
A. I., 105&ndash;2&ndash;11). Philip II, on November 30, 1568, had
ordered that no <i lang="es">encomienda</i> should yield more than 2000
pesos (<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n,</i> 6&ndash;8&ndash;30).</p>
<p class="footnote">Loarca states that there were also <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i> in the Camarines provinces in southeast Luzon and
in IIocos, in the north of the same island. These <i lang=

4, 1620, the governor of the Philippines was authorized to bestow
<i lang="es">encomiendas,</i> with the provision that if he neglected
to do so for a period of sixty days the vacant holdings should be
bestowed by the audiencia. On October 24, 1655, Philip IV ordered that

connection may be noted the distinction between the two classes of
<i lang="es">encomiendas</i> which was made for purposes of
administration. Private <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> were those which
had been granted to private persons, conquerors, discoverers, soldiers,
or persons who paid a regular rent, usually a third of the gross
tribute collected. These were originally granted for life, and might be
held for two subsequent generations. Later (after 1655), the usual
period of confirmation was ten years, for persons who rented <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i> as a business proposition. The royal <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i> were situated near cities or ports and the income
from them was reserved for the expenses and necessities of the royal
estate, the payment of salaries, and other governmental expenses.
Private <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> became royal on the death of an
incumbent if he had no heirs, or on the expiration of the contract. The
tribute from royal <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> was collected by the
royal treasury. Morga&rsquo;s Sucesos, Blair and Robertson, XVI, 157;
also <i>ibid.,</i> VIII, 27; see Bourne, &ldquo;Historical
introduction,&rdquo; <i>ibid.,</i> I, 39&ndash;40.</p>
<p class="footnote">On June 7, 1597, the king, as a suggestion for the
increase of funds for the maintenance of the government, wrote to the
audiencia that a greater number of royal <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>
should be established, and that the governor should not be permitted to
assign so many to private persons (King to the Audiencia, June 7, 1597,
A. I., 105&ndash;2&ndash;1). On February 16, 1602, the king again
addressed the audiencia on the subject of the royal <i lang=
"es">encomiendas,</i> desiring to know why the tribute from them had so
materially decreased, it having reached the low mark of 2500 pesos. In
answer, the same reason for this falling off was suggested as in the
letter above quoted, namely, that the governor had assigned many
<i lang="es">encomiendas</i> to his friends (King to the Audiencia,
February 16, 1602, A. I., 105&ndash;2&ndash;1). Francisco de la Misa,
<i lang="es">factor</i> of the royal treasury of Manila, in a letter to
the king, dated May 31, 1595, stated that the royal <i lang=
"es">encomiendas,</i> which had been established to provide revenue for
the payment of the salaries of <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores,
tenientes, oficiales reales,</i> and even that of the governor, had
diminished greatly in number, so that not enough revenue was derived
from them to meet the expenses for which they had been created. Misa
concluded with a recommendation that eight royal <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i> of the value of 8000 pesos a year should be
established out of the first private <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> that
were vacated (Misa to the King, May 31, 1595, A. I.
67&ndash;6&ndash;29).</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2570" href="#xd21e2570src" name="xd21e2570">19</a></span> The
<i lang="es">alcabala</i> (<i lang="es">al que vale,</i>
&ldquo;according to value&rdquo;) was a percentage tax levied on goods
(movable and immovable) sold or exchanged. Merchants were held
accountable for the payment of this tax, and for this purpose their
accounts were examined by royal officials at regular intervals
(Escriche, <i lang="es">Diccionario,</i> I, 143). It was first
introduced into the Indies by Philip II in 1574, having been levied in
Spain as early as 1079, though not in its perfected form. In accordance
with the tariff of November 1, 1591, it was exacted from merchants,
apothecaries, <i lang="es">encomenderos</i> (having farms and
cattle-ranches), ragpickers, cloth-makers, silversmiths, goldsmiths,
blacksmiths, and shoemakers. An <i lang="es">alcabala</i> was paid on
wine. By the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of June 7, 1576, the rate
of <i lang="es">alcabala</i> was fixed at two per cent. In Per&uacute;
it was raised to four per cent during the administration of the Conde
de Chinch&oacute;n as viceroy and was collected at that rate there
until the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of July 26, 1776, raised it to
six per cent. This rate was paid thereafter in the Spanish colonies
(<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n,</i> 8&ndash;13&ndash;1 to 14, notes,
2 and 4), except for an increase in the rate to 8 per cent in 1782, to
meet the added expenses of war. The old rate of 6 per cent was restored
in 1791 (transcripts of these <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> exist in
A. I., 87&ndash;1&ndash;20).</p>
<p class="footnote">Exemptions from this tax were made in favor of
churches, monasteries, and prelates when they bought or sold goods not
for profit. When they engaged in commerce for its own sake they were
obliged to pay the <i lang="es">alcabala</i> in the same way as laymen
(<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n,</i> 8&ndash;13&ndash;17). Goods
belonging to the Santa Cruzada, provisions bought, sold or stored which
were destined for the poor, and munitions of war paid no <i lang=
"es">alcabala</i> (<i>ibid.,</i> 18&ndash;23). Indians were also
exempted under certain circumstances (<i>ibid.,</i> 24; see entire
Title 13 of Book 8, <i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n,</i> for further
specifications regarding the payment of this tax). In 1568 Philip II
exempted the Philippines for thirty years. As noted above, the <i lang=
"es">alcabala</i> was not introduced regularly into the Indies until
1574, though it was levied in individual cases as early as 1558. Even
earlier than this Pizarro had obtained the right to levy it in
Per&uacute; for a period of a hundred years (<i>ibid.,</i>
8&ndash;13&ndash;1; note 1), but Philip II ordered it paid in the
Philippines on August 9, 1589 (<i>ibid.,</i> 9&ndash;45&ndash;66).</p>
<p class="footnote">The <i lang="es">almojarifazgo,</i> like the
<i lang="es">alcabala,</i> had been utilized early in the history of
the Peninsula and because a productive source of revenue, it was
introduced into the Indies. The earliest law dealing with this tax in
New Spain was promulgated by Charles V on October 18, 1553, exempting
cargoes which had already paid the tax in Spain. On June 24, 1566, and
on December 28, 1568, Philip II ordered a five per cent export tax on
all goods leaving Seville for the Indies (the ordinance of December 28,
1562, having fixed it at two and a half per cent) and an import tax in
the Indies on these same goods of ten per cent, making in all a tax of
fifteen per cent. Wine was to pay a ten per cent import and export tax
respectively, making a total of twenty per cent paid on that commodity
(<i>ibid.,</i> 8&ndash;15&ndash;1, 2, 8). The law of April 21, 1574,
ordered a two and a half export and a five per cent import tax on goods
shipped between colonies (<i>ibid.,</i> 10). On August 9, 1589, a three
per cent <i lang="es">almojarifazgo</i> was authorized in the
Philippines, with exemptions on provisions, munitions, and other
specified articles brought to the Islands by the Chinese, Japanese,
Siamese, and Borneans (<i>ibid.,</i> 22, 24). The tax on Chinese
merchandise was raised from three to six per cent on November 20, 1606
(<i>ibid.,</i> 23). Chinese goods from the Philippines paid a ten per
cent <i lang="es">almojarifazgo</i> at Acapulco. This tax was also paid
on leaving the Philippines or other New Spain ports and on entrance at
Acapulco (<i>ibid.,</i> 21). For exemptions see <i lang=
"es">Recopilaci&oacute;n,</i> 8&ndash;15&ndash;26 to 30.</p>

defender of the Indians was wanted in this case to serve them in the
courts. The bishop, at this time, was protector of the Indians and in
that capacity had protested against the abuses of the <i lang=

courts and defend the Indians in litigation.</p>
<p class="footnote">The law of March 17, 1593, which ultimately
established a defender of the Indians in Manila, filled the need voiced
by Rivera. The law referred to read as follows: &ldquo;The protection
and defense of the Indians in the Philippines was entrusted by us to
the bishops there, but having recognized that the latter cannot conform
to the demands, <i lang="es">autos</i> and judicial summons which
require their personal presence, we order that our president-governor
shall name a protector and defender of the Indians, assigning to him a
sufficient salary from the taxes levied pro rata upon the Indians who
are under the royal jurisdiction and on private <i lang=
"es">encomiendas,</i> without touching the revenues of our royal
<i lang="es">hacienda</i> which are for other purposes. And we declare
that this does not signify that it is our intention to deprive the
bishops of the superintendence and protection of the Indians in
general&rdquo; (<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n,</i>
6&ndash;6&ndash;8).</p>
<p class="footnote">Philip II, on January 10, 1589, restored the office
of protector or defender of the Indians in the Indies generally. It was
stated in this law that as a result of the earlier abolition of the
office many inconveniences and injustices had arisen. The law
authorized the appointment of a person of good character and morals to
the office (<i>ibid.,</i> 1). The reform of April 9, 1591, required
that the appointee should be a lawyer, and that there should be a
defender of the Indians attached to each audiencia (<i>ibid.,</i> 3).
The reform of March 11, 1784, provided that the <i lang=

<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i> is singularly indefinite regarding
the rate or amount of tribute to be assessed in New Spain. Beyond the
stipulation that tribute levied under the supervision of viceroys,
presidents, and audiencias should be moderate and just, practically
nothing is said as to the amount that should be collected (See <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dulas</i> of June 19, 1536, and September 29, 1555,
<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>, 6&ndash;5&ndash;21), excepting
certain increases as stipulated in the law of November 1, 1591
(<i lang="es">ley 16</i>).</p>
<p class="footnote">According to the laws just cited, the rate was to
be fixed by the officials mentioned above. By <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> of December 19, 1534, the <i lang="es">oficiales
reales</i> were empowered to fix the rate of tribute (<i>ibid</i>.,
28). Reductions in the rate of tribute were to be authorized by the
<i lang="es">fiscal</i> and <i lang="es">oficiales reales</i>
(<i>ibid.</i>, 29). Apparently the rate varied according to the
locality (<i>ibid.</i>, 1 to 5, 16, 17), and in the <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dulas</i> of 1536 and 1555, cited above, consideration
was given to the rate formerly paid by the Indians to their <i lang=
"es">caciques</i>. Fonseca y Urrutia (<i lang="es">Historia de la real
hacienda</i>, I, 417 <i>et seq.</i>) tell us that the tribute paid in
the province of Tlascala in 1572 was 13 <i lang="es">reales</i>; in
1564 the rate for New Spain was fixed at two pesos, and in 1600 it was
reduced to one peso of eight <i lang="es">reales</i>. (Bancroft,
<i>History of Mexico</i>, II, 586&ndash;9.) Humboldt (Political Essay,
II, 431&ndash;2) states that there had been a gradual diminution of
tribute paid by the Indians during the hundred years preceding his
visit. In 1601, he states, Indians paid 32 <i lang="es">reales</i>
tribute and 4 <i lang="es">reales</i> additional, <i lang="es">de
servicio</i>, in all, about 23 francs. It had been reduced, little by
little, till the amount actually paid was from 5 to 15 francs, and,
&ldquo;in the greater part of Mexico,&rdquo; he states, &ldquo;the
head-tax amounts to 11 francs.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote">Archbishop Benavides, of Manila, writing in 1600
(Zulueta Papers, date and place number not given) pleaded for the
abolition of the tribute in the Philippines, stating that while the
collection of tribute in New Spain was justifiable because the natives
had been accustomed to paying tribute before the Spaniards came, the
custom was entirely new in the Philippines, since the native princes
had never levied tribute. On the other hand, various persons writing
from the Philippines at different times urged that the tribute there
should be increased to the rate imposed in New Spain.</p>
<p class="footnote">The money value of the tribute in the Philippines
was fixed at eight <i lang="es">reales</i> by Legaspi. It could be paid
either in gold or in kind. <span class="corr" id="xd21e3202" title=
"Source: Morga">De Morga</span> tells us that the <i lang=
"es">encomenderos</i> made great profit by receiving the payment in
rice, cotton, cloth, fowls, and other commodities, at a cheap rate,
selling those same articles later to the improvident natives at greatly
increased prices (Morga&rsquo;s Sucesos, Blair and Robertson, XVI,
159). When Dasmari&ntilde;as arrived as governor in 1590, the tribute
was raised from eight to ten <i lang="es">reales</i> (<i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> of August 9, 1589, <i lang=
"es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>, 6&ndash;5&ndash;65, also A. I.,
105&ndash;2&ndash;11). While the eight <i lang="es">reales</i> were to
be appropriated by the <i lang="es">encomenderos</i>, the additional
two <i lang="es">reales</i> were to be distributed between the
religious and military governments in proportions of one-half to one
and a half (Blair and Robertson, XVI, 160).</p>
<p class="footnote">In the instructions of May 23, 1593, to Governor
<span class="corr" id="xd21e3229" title=
"Source: Dasmarina">Dasmari&ntilde;as</span>, reference was made to a
current rate of eight <i lang="es">reales</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, IX, 249),
so it would seem that the local rate had been reduced from ten to eight
<i lang="es">reales</i> at some date between 1589 and 1593. On February
16, 1602, the rate was restored at ten <i lang="es">reales</i>
(<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>, 6&ndash;5&ndash;65), and was so
continued until a subsequent regulation made optional on the part of
the natives the payment of the ten <i lang="es">reales</i> or four
<i lang="es">reales</i> and a fowl. On August 19, 1623, Fray Juan de
Balmaseda complained that the <i lang="es">encomenderos</i> were making
the natives pay ten <i lang="es">reales</i> in addition to the fowl and
that the above law was thus resulting in the payment of sixteen
<i lang="es">reales</i> tribute (A. I., 68&ndash;1&ndash;63).
Accordingly, on November 21, 1625, a <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> was
issued which eliminated the substitution of the fowl, and the rate was
restored at ten <i lang="es">reales</i>, payable in gold or silver (A.
I., 105&ndash;2&ndash;1). The king, in response to complaints against
the collection of tributes in the provinces of Camarines and Albay,
issued a <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> on September 25, 1697, ordering

because they show how intensely nationalistic were the respective

fact that the Portuguese regarded their former colonies as still

Archbishop of Manila, in a letter to the king, on August 15, 1624,
stated that the principal motive which influenced Philip II to
re-establish the audiencia at the time of Governor Tello, was that in a
district so remote and distant from his royal presence the governors
might not be so absolute, but that there might be a superior arm to
check them, and to prevent their extortions from innocent people (Blair
and Robertson, XXI, 95). It is certain, too, that the audiencia was
also destined to champion the royal prerogative in the face of the
encroachments of the higher officials of the church. This need was
especially urged by Morga.</p>
<p class="footnote">Grao y Monfalc&oacute;n, the procurator of the
merchants of Manila at the court in 1636, wrote on June 13 of that
year: &ldquo;In the year 590 the royal Audiencia of Manila was
suppressed ... and its suppression must also be reckoned among the
hardships of that city ... because of those which it suffered until the

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER III</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE AUDIENCIA</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The audiencia was first and always a tribunal of
justice. It was established for the purpose of trying cases and
settling disputes. Had it no other functions than the purely judicial,
however, it would not have played the important part which it did in
colonial administration during two hundred years of its existence. Its
chief interest to the student of history and government will not be so
much its activity as a judicial institution as the relations it bore to
other departments of the government. Its extraordinary powers and
functions developed incidentally at first through the establishment of
the institution in colonies where no other agency existed to deal with
the unforeseen problems and necessities which arose from time to time.
The gradual assumption and exercise of non-judicial functions are
therefore the chief characteristics to be noted in the history of the
Audiencia of Manila.</p>
<p>The aim of this chapter, however, will be to study the audiencia in
its capacity as a civil judiciary and to clear the way for the
discussion in subsequent chapters of the wider, and from the present
viewpoint, more notable fields of its activity. An effort will be made
to describe its judicial procedure, the kinds of cases which it tried,
the limitations on its jurisdiction&mdash;what courts were inferior to
it, and what authority was superior. This investigation will be made
from the viewpoint of the historian, rather than from that of the
student of jurisprudence, subject to such limitations as a lack of
knowledge of the law may impose. We shall first consider the procedure
of the audiencia as authorized by the laws of the Indies, illustrating
this procedure by the citation of actual cases in practice.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>The powers and duties of the Audiencia of Manila as defined in the
special decree of establishment of May 5, 1583, have been set forth in
the preceding chapter. By this decree the audiencia was granted civil
and criminal jurisdiction in cases of appeal from the lower courts and
original jurisdiction in those affecting the government, and the
conduct of its officials. The authority of the audiencia in the latter
cases was exercised through the appeals which came to it from the
special investigators and visitors who tried these officials in first
instance.</p>
<p>The laws of the Indies, after prescribing the time of meeting and
the hours of the daily sessions of the audiencia, made their first
important judicial regulation by forbidding viceroys and presidents to
assist in the determination of suits. Cases must be tried by the
properly qualified <i lang="es">oidores</i>, yet the president (viceroy
or governor) was to sign the decisions with the magistrates.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3848src" href="#xd21e3848" name="xd21e3848src">1</a>
Unless the president were a lawyer, he was even denied cognizance of
military cases. The audiencia had jurisdiction over appeals from the
viceroy or governor in all government matters to which any official or
private citizen might take exception.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3853src" href="#xd21e3853" name="xd21e3853src">2</a> In case of
disagreement between the audiencia and the president, it was prescribed
that the question at issue should be carried to the Council of the
Indies. In case the majority of the audiencia agreed to follow a
certain course of action, the viceroy or president was forbidden to
contravene or oppose that action. Instead, he was ordered to abide by
it, appealing to the Council of the Indies for final settlement of the
contention.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3858src" href="#xd21e3858" name=
"xd21e3858src">3</a></p>
<p>There were many laws regulating the relations between the audiencia
and the governor, most of which will be noted in greater detail in a
subsequent chapter. The most important were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>the laws
which ordered that the viceroys of New Spain and Per&uacute; should
leave to the audiencias entire jurisdiction over <i lang=
"es">residencias</i>, questions involving the marriage
relation<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3870src" href="#xd21e3870" name=
"xd21e3870src">4</a> and the administration of property of deceased
persons.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3873src" href="#xd21e3873" name=
"xd21e3873src">5</a> A law especially referring to the Philippines
ordered the Audiencia of Manila to abstain from interfering with the
government of the Chinese in the Pari&aacute;n.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3878src" href="#xd21e3878" name="xd21e3878src">6</a> This did not
forbid the trial on appeal of cases relating to the Chinese, since in
practice the audiencia had authority to take cognizance of such cases.
Certain extra duties were required of the oldest <i lang="es">oidor</i>
of the audiencia, who was known as the <i lang="es">decano</i>. He was
given complete authority over the tribunal in the absence of the
president. He might assign cases to the magistrates, designate judges
for special duties and determine all matters relating to the interior
organization and government of the tribunal. These functions were
assumed, after 1776, by the regent, and the prerogatives of the office
of <i lang="es">decano</i> became merely nominal, except when the
regent was absent. In audiencias whose size permitted it, the oldest
<i lang="es">oidor</i>, or the regent, after that office was created,
could determine whether sessions should consist of one or two <i lang=
"es">salas</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3903src" href="#xd21e3903"
name="xd21e3903src">7</a> An audiencia was legally constituted,
however, if only one magistrate were present.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3909src" href="#xd21e3909" name="xd21e3909src">8</a> The
audiencia was commanded to guard its proceedings with great secrecy,
and such rules were formulated for its magistrates as would enable the
tribunal to uphold its dignity, and command the respect of the
commonwealth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<p>Cases of first instance were tried by inferior judges who were below
the category of <i lang="es">oidores</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3920src" href="#xd21e3920" name="xd21e3920src">9</a> As noted in
a former chapter, these judges were the <i lang="es">alcaldes
ordinarios</i>, <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i>, and <i lang=
"es">corregidores</i>. The former tried civil and criminal cases in the
towns and cities and the last two exercised extensive jurisdiction in
the provinces. Cases were appealed from them to the audiencia.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3935src" href="#xd21e3935" name=
"xd21e3935src">10</a> The audiencia was forbidden to concern itself
with cases of first instance, excepting certain criminal suits which
originated within five leagues of Manila.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3940src" href="#xd21e3940" name="xd21e3940src">11</a></p>
<p>A separate <i lang="es">sala</i>, for the trial of criminal cases
was created in the audiencias of Lima and Mexico. The magistrates
serving in these <i lang="es">salas</i> were designated as <i lang=
"es">alcaldes del crimen</i>. They had jurisdiction in first instance
over the criminal cases arising within five leagues of the capital, as
referred to above, and in second instance over those appealed from the
provincial judges.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3962src" href=
"#xd21e3962" name="xd21e3962src">12</a> The <i lang="es">oidores</i> in
these audiencias confined themselves to civil suits, but in audiencias
where there were no <i lang="es">alcaldes del crimen</i>, the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> were authorized to try both civil and criminal
cases.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3977src" href="#xd21e3977" name=
"xd21e3977src">13</a> The magistrates of the Audiencia of Manila had
both criminal and civil jurisdiction, as that tribunal belonged to the
latter class. When the number of <i lang="es">oidores</i> present was
insufficient to do the work of the audiencia, <i lang="es">alcaldes
ordinarios</i> or <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> who had the
necessary qualifications might be transferred temporarily to the
tribunal. When acting as <i lang="es">oidores</i> they could not try
cases over which they had formerly exercised original
jurisdiction.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3995src" href="#xd21e3995"
name="xd21e3995src">14</a></p>
<p>A system of procedure was prescribed for the trial of cases before
the audiencia and the order fixed in which these should come up for
consideration. It was ordered that two slates <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>should
be kept, one for cases classified according to their importance and
another for those to be tried by rotation. Cases of the first category
and those which were especially urgent might supersede the latter, but
when there were none of the former the second slate was to be adhered
to.</p>
<p>Cases relating to <i lang="es">real hacienda</i> took precedence
over all others. The president was instructed to see personally that
these cases should not be subjected to delay and that at least one day
a week should be set aside for their adjudication. Next in importance
were cases involving infractions of royal ordinances and laws. Probate
cases were given one day a week. Two days weekly were set aside for the
consideration of suits which arose between Indians and between Indians
and Spaniards. Cases involving the poor, however, were to take
precedence over these. The audiencia was made responsible for the good
treatment of the Indians and it was charged with the obligation of
seeing that all suits to which Indians were parties should be tried
without loss of time. Delays resulting from the carelessness of lawyers
and from their eagerness to profit at the expense of the natives were
discouraged. Matters of slight importance which pertained to the
Indians were to be dispatched by decrees of the audiencias and
viceroys; this provision was designed to avoid contentious litigation,
to which the natives were characteristically inclined. It also sought
thereby to protect them from dishonest judges and lawyers. Any and all
of the cases mentioned in this paragraph were considered to be of such
importance that they were classified among the first to be tried and
determined prior to those involving property, commercial affairs, and
ordinary transactions. Of the latter cases those already decided were
to be reopened before the hearing of new cases of the same class. Cases
involving the poor were to be given speedy consideration.<a class=

href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>waiting should be the criterion
for the consideration of the remaining cases.</p>

<p>The laws regulating the audiencia&rsquo;s jurisdiction in civil
cases seem to have varied according to the time and the policy of the
government. The audiencia exercised both original and appellate
jurisdiction, as we have already noted. Most of the civil suits tried
by the tribunal were appealed to it from inferior judges. A law was
made in 1563 ordering that cases involving less than twenty pesos might
be tried by verbal process.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4043src" href=
"#xd21e4043" name="xd21e4043src">19</a> This law would seem to have
excluded cases of less than that value from appeal to the audiencia, as
the processes had to be committed to writing in order to be appealed.
The <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> of November 26, 1573, and August
10, 1574, fixed the minimum amount that might be appealed at six pesos
of eight <i lang="es">reales</i>, or 3000 <i lang=
"es">maraved&iacute;s</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4057src" href=
"#xd21e4057" name="xd21e4057src">20</a> Charles V in 1542 promulgated
an important law for the regulation of appeals to the audiencia. It
provided that the smallest amount that might be appealed should be
300,000 <i lang="es">maraved&iacute;s</i> (667 pesos).<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4066src" href="#xd21e4066" name=
"xd21e4066src">21</a> This law <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89"
href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>was re-promulgated on September
24, 1568, and on September 22, 1626.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4077src" href="#xd21e4077" name="xd21e4077src">22</a> The
provisions of these laws, however, probably applied only to such cases
as might come from provincial justices, since appeals from city judges
and <i lang="es">ayuntamientos</i> could be taken over by the audiencia
with less trouble and expense, because of the proximity of the
tribunal. As a matter of fact, this opinion is seemingly substantiated
by a new law, dated June 13, 1634, which ordered that an appeal from an
<i lang="es">ayuntamiento</i> should not be received in an audiencia
unless the suit involved a sum greater than 60,000 <i lang=
"es">maraved&iacute;s</i>, or 133 pesos.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4092src" href="#xd21e4092" name="xd21e4092src">23</a> This was
considerably less, it will be seen, than the amount fixed as the limit
by the law immediately preceding it, which was promulgated in 1626.</p>
<p>The laws establishing the finality of the jurisdiction of the
audiencia were also altered from time to time. The earliest law on the
subject, dated April 24, 1545, ordered that no appeal should be made
from the tribunal in cases involving less than 6000 <i lang=
"es">maraved&iacute;s</i> (13.3 pesos).<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4102src" href="#xd21e4102" name="xd21e4102src">24</a> This limit
was raised to 200 pesos by <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> of April 4,
1558, and March 4, 1559, and by the ordinance of 1563.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4110src" href="#xd21e4110" name=
"xd21e4110src">25</a></p>
<p>In 1542, the jurisdiction of the audiencia was made final in all
cases appealed from the ordinary courts.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4117src" href="#xd21e4117" name="xd21e4117src">26</a> The

"xd21e4127src">28</a> This was partially abrogated by the law of
February 13, 1620, which ordered that cases involving 6000 pesos of 450

<p>Decisions were reached by the concurrence of a majority of the
magistrates trying the case. When there were only two <i lang=

full quota of magistrates were present and the votes were equally
divided, the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> might be called in to decide the
case, but if the latter were prosecuting the case, or were otherwise
incapacitated, a duly qualified lawyer might be chosen to serve as a
special magistrate.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4151src" href=
"#xd21e4151" name="xd21e4151src">30</a> This rule did not apply to the
revision of sentences in civil cases wherein the value exceeded 300,000
<i lang="es">maraved&iacute;s</i>; in these the concurrence of three
magistrates was necessary.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4159src" href=
"#xd21e4159" name="xd21e4159src">31</a> A record of the judicial
decisions of the magistrates was kept in the official journal of the
audiencia. Decisions and legal papers had to be signed by the
magistrates involved. <i lang="es">Oidores</i> who registered
dissenting opinions were obliged to affix their signatures to the
<i lang="es">autos</i> with those who had voted in the affirmative, but
the negative votes were also recorded.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>While the audiencia might repeal the written opinion of an inferior
judge in review of sentence, the revision of verbal decisions of
<i lang="es">alcaldes ordinarios</i> could be accomplished only when
the <i lang="es">alcalde</i> in question had been summoned before the
tribunal and the reasons for his decision had been investigated in his
presence.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4187src" href="#xd21e4187" name=
"xd21e4187src">33</a> The audiencia, therefore, exercised appellate
jurisdiction over civil and criminal cases tried in first instance by
the judges of the provinces.</p>
<p>If an <i lang="es">alcalde mayor</i> or other inferior judge failed
to comply with the instructions laid down for his guidance, or if he
were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=

justice, he was held to account by the visiting <i lang="es">oidor</i>
who was dispatched at regular intervals for the inspection of the
provinces&mdash;and for the judicial scrutiny of the provincial courts.
In cases of notorious injustice special <i lang="es">pesquisidores</i>,
usually <i lang="es">oidores</i>, were sent at once for the correction
of the abuse in question, at the expense of the offending
officials.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4209src" href="#xd21e4209" name=

id="xd21e4226src" href="#xd21e4226" name="xd21e4226src">35</a> The
visiting <i lang="es">oidores</i> imposed fines in accordance with a

<p>It was the policy of the government to give the audiencia final
jurisdiction in as many cases as possible. It was desirable to endow
the colonial tribunals and authorities with sufficient power to make
them worthy of respect. At the same time it was necessary to relieve
the Council of the Indies of the duty of hearing the vast number of
individual suits which would inevitably come to it if that tribunal
were made too accessible. The Council was occupied with appeals in
government and justice from all of Spain&rsquo;s colonies. It has been
noted that the limit of value of cases which could be appealed from the
audiencia to the Council of the Indies was raised in 1620 from 200 to
6000 pesos. This <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>would seem to indicate a growing tendency to
confine suits involving individuals to the colonial tribunals, thus
increasing the importance of the audiencias, and at the same time
making the Council of the Indies more exclusively a tribunal of
administration. This change, however, was never completely effected,
despite the various expedients adopted to discourage the appeal of
individual cases. Persons appealing were obliged to guarantee the
expenses of suit. The great cost, the delays, and the distance
altogether made appeal difficult. Appeals of longer standing than two
years were not received from the Philippines in the Council of the
Indies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4254src" href="#xd21e4254" name=
"xd21e4254src">38</a> An investigation of the records shows that most
of the cases appealed to the Council of the Indies involved
administrative law in some form, having to do either with the
prosecution of officials, their removal from office, the prosecution of
bondsmen, <i lang="es">residencias</i>, conflicts of jurisdiction, or
with appeals from the decision of the audiencia in commercial and
ecclesiastical matters.</p>
<p>The gradual extension of the jurisdiction of the audiencia over
<i lang="es">encomiendas</i> may be cited as an example of the changes
in the authority of the tribunal and in its relation to the Council of
the Indies. The first important legislation in regulation of the
<i lang="es">encomienda</i> was the celebrated law of Malines,
promulgated in that city by Charles V, on October 20, 1545, and
enunciated at successive dates until 1610. The law prescribed the
course which was to be pursued by the audiencia in suits between
individuals relative to <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> or the Indians
thereon. In these contentions the Council of the Indies and not the
audiencia was the final arbiter. The duty of the latter tribunal was to
collect evidence in these cases, taking the testimony of witnesses
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>for both sides and remitting all papers, sealed,
to the Council of the Indies. The council, on consideration of the
evidence, rendered the final decision. The audiencia had to conclude
its part of the investigation and file its report within a period of
three months. This time limit was extended to six months in 1554. The
purpose of this law was to guarantee justice in the assignment and
retention of <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> by removing them from the
control of the audiencias, whose magistrates, as experience had proved,
often allowed themselves to be influenced by local prejudices. <i lang=
"es">Encomiendas</i> were to be assigned by the king, in theory at
least, and no other authority save the monarch and his council could
exercise jurisdiction over them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4285src"
href="#xd21e4285" name="xd21e4285src">39</a></p>
<p>The audiencia was, however, authorized to act as the protector of
persons holding Indians on <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>, to see that
they were not unjustly deprived of or wrongfully disturbed in their
holdings. In case a person were thus deprived of his Indians, the
audiencia was empowered to restore conditions to their former state. If
the aggressor persisted, or cared to contest the right of his opponent
to the Indians in question, the audiencia was ordered to observe the
law of Malines, collecting all the evidence in the case, and forwarding
it to the Council of the Indies for final decision. The frequency of
litigation, however, and the vast number of unimportant cases which
arose under the provisions of the law of Malines came to demand too
much of the time and attention of the Council of the Indies, thereby
causing many delays in suits involving <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>. In
order to remedy this defect, Philip III, on April 17, 1609, conferred
on the audiencia jurisdiction over all cases involving <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i>, <i lang="es">repartimientos</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4304src" href="#xd21e4304" name=
"xd21e4304src">40</a> tributes, and despoliations of Indians up to the
value <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>of a thousand ducats.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4352src" href="#xd21e4352" name="xd21e4352src">41</a> Cases
involving a greater value were still to be settled in conformity with
the law of Malines. Finally, in 1624 it was ordered that in suits which
did not involve more than three Indians and in cases wherein the costs
of litigation exceeded the amount in dispute, the decree of the
governor should prevail. For obvious reasons, the audiencia could not
concern itself with such cases, but when the value of the Indians
justified the attention of the tribunal, its decisions were final,
taking precedence over those of the governor.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4357src" href="#xd21e4357" name="xd21e4357src">42</a> This, then,
was the final status of the jurisdiction of the audiencia over <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i> as set forth in the laws of the Indies. In the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>Philippines the authority of the tribunal in
regard to them was neither executive nor legislative, except in such
cases and on such occasions as we shall refer to later. The judicial
authority of the Audiencia of Manila over <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>
was indisputable.</p>
<p>Having indicated the general basis upon which the authority of the
audiencia rested, we may more precisely define its jurisdiction by
reviewing a few of the most characteristic cases which were tried in
the tribunal in accordance with the laws already discussed. The
statement has been made that at the time of its establishment the
audiencia was needed as a court of justice and that it was removed in
1589 for political reasons rather than because of the inadequacy or
failure of the institution as a tribunal of justice. In the preceding
chapter we saw that the audiencia was designed to relieve the executive
of judicial duties, such as the trial of cases appealed from the
<i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> of the provinces and the <i lang=
"es">alcaldes ordinarios</i> of the city. These functions, up to the
time of the establishment of the audiencia, had been exercised by the
governor. This had resulted in favoritism and in a perversion of
justice to the private ends of the governor and of his friends. Perhaps
the chief evil under the system had proceeded from the governor&rsquo;s
double jurisdiction, as both executive and judge, over cases involving
<i lang="es">encomiendas</i> and <i lang="es">encomenderos</i>. The
governor assigned <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> in the name of the king,
and he was also judge with final jurisdiction over all suits involving
them, the law of Malines being impossible of execution in the
Philippines before the establishment of the audiencia, and after its
withdrawal in 1589.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4388src" href=
"#xd21e4388" name="xd21e4388src">43</a></p>
<p>The same was true in regard to commercial cases, and complaints were
ever arising against the governor&rsquo;s high-handed proceedings in
the allotment of cargo space on the galleons to his friends, and his
monopolization of the best Chinese goods that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>came to
Manila. The governor, as in the assignment of <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i>, enjoyed an undue advantage in these matters, for
at the same time that he was the executive with the power of bestowing
these favors, he was the sole judge in all contentions which arose
regarding commerce. It was therefore distinctly in the interests of
justice that a supreme court should be established, and it is easy to
understand why those who had profited by the absence of the audiencia
should oppose its restoration, and why others should take the opposite
view.</p>
<p>Soon after the audiencia was abolished in 1589, arguments were
presented at court for its restoration. From the large number of
petitions that were presented, two, aside from those discussed in the
preceding chapter, may be cited here because they illustrate the
disadvantages from a judicial point of view of having the
administration of justice in the hands of the governor, with appeal to
Mexico. Francisco de la Misa, <i lang="es">factor</i> of the treasury
of Manila, wrote a memorial to the king on May 31, 1595,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4406src" href="#xd21e4406" name=
"xd21e4406src">44</a> referring to the delay which had arisen in the
trial of suits involving <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>: the jurisdiction
of the governor was not final; appeals had to be carried to the
Audiencia of Mexico and cases involving a thousand ducats or more had
to be taken from that tribunal to the Council of the Indies;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4412src" href="#xd21e4412" name=
"xd21e4412src">45</a> this meant two appeals and much delay. He
mentioned certain cases which had been pending two years, and showed
that, because of the delay to which they had been subjected in Mexico,
it would be at least two years more before the decisions could be
returned. Misa said that conditions had reverted to the state which had
existed before the audiencia was established; a much larger number of
cases was awaiting trial than the governor and his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>lieutenant could attempt to try. These
difficulties were multiplied by the fact that there was no <i lang=
"es">fiscal</i>, an officer whose services as legal adviser to the
government and as prosecuting attorney were indispensable.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4424src" href="#xd21e4424" name=
"xd21e4424src">46</a></p>
<p>Misa petitioned for a reform of the law which had established the
governor as judge of ultimate recourse in cases involving one thousand
pesos (ducats) or less. He believed it advisable to reduce the limit of
the value of cases settled in the colony from one thousand to four
hundred pesos and appeal all those exceeding the latter sum to the
Audiencia of Mexico. It would result in a more equitable administration
of justice, he stated, if the trial of important cases were conducted
in second instance before that tribunal. This practice, though subject
to great delay, would have the advantage of guaranteeing the review of
these cases by a competent and properly qualified magistracy rather
than by a biased and tyrannical executive. He alleged that four hundred
pesos in the Philippines meant as much as a thousand elsewhere. Another
suggestion advanced by Misa was that suits and investigations involving
<i lang="es">real hacienda</i> should be tried by competent judges,
rather than by the governor, whose own personal interest in the cases
was often too great to ensure fair trial. Another evil pointed out by
Misa, and a fairly typical one throughout the history of the colony,
was the delay and uncertainty of the <i lang="es">residencia</i>. This
defect was particularly apparent at this time because all cases of
<i lang="es">residencia</i> had to be sent to Mexico, since there was
no tribunal in Manila with jurisdiction on appeal over these official
investigations. Misa described the plight of various <i lang=
"es">alcaldes mayores</i>, <i lang="es">corregidores</i>, and other
officials who had been investigated and suspended from office, awaiting
the outcome of the <i lang="es">residencia</i>. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>There
were no persons to take their places; as a result, the suspended
officials were without gainful employment, while their districts and
offices reverted to a state of lawlessness, barbarism and disorder,
without governor, judges, or incumbents. The governor had attempted to
remedy the trouble by making temporary appointments from among the
removed officials, but this he had no authority to do; moreover, the
reinstatement of officials whose conduct was under investigation was
subversive of the best interests of government and justice. The
governor&rsquo;s action in these cases had raised a storm of protest in
the colony, yet he was forced to take these steps in preference to
leaving the natives without government and protection. Misa presented
this picture of the state of affairs in the colony to show the evil
results of the absence from the Philippines of a tribunal with
authority to conduct <i lang="es">residencias</i> and to provide
offices.</p>
<p>While this series of complaints was not followed by an open advocacy
of the establishment of a royal audiencia in Manila, the defects which
were pointed out showed the desirability of putting an end to the
governor&rsquo;s intervention in judicial matters. There can be no
question but that the arrival at court of such letters showed clearly
the need of a tribunal at Manila for the administration of justice.</p>
<p>Complaints were also directed against this state of affairs by
Antonio de Morga, lieutenant-governor of the Islands. This official
argued that the commonwealth required an audiencia in order to secure a
more equitable administration of justice.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4463src" href="#xd21e4463" name="xd21e4463src">47</a> He called
attention to the overcrowded docket of the court over which he presided
and emphasized the impossibility of the satisfactory termination of the
cases waiting to be tried. That the defects referred to in these
communications were appreciated at court is evidenced by the <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> of May 26, 1595, which emphasized <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>the
necessity of administering justice in the Philippines with
&ldquo;universal equality, mildness and satisfaction.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4473src" href="#xd21e4473" name=
"xd21e4473src">48</a></p>
<p>Nevertheless the presence of a tribunal had the effect of
encouraging the inhabitants of the Islands to litigation. It has been
said that there have been more lawsuits in the Philippines than in any
other country of the same size and population, which remark probably
would apply to any country where the Spanish judicial system had lately
obtained. This condition was no doubt due to the fact that adequate
facilities existed whereby the natives could go to law. Lawyers and
judges were ever unduly ready to encourage and hear any suits which
might arise if there were any way in which profit might be derived
therefrom. Pardo de Tavera, in discussing these phases of the legal
history of the Islands, states that the laws protected the native, but
at the same time they kept him in a state of perpetual tutelage.
Judgments were passed by native magistrates in suits between natives in
the later days of Spanish rule, but in general throughout the period of
Spain&rsquo;s domination suits were prosecuted under the direction of a
<i>protector of the Indians</i> in case one party to a suit was a
Spaniard, or when the rights of the natives were in any way jeopardized
or injured by a Spaniard. &ldquo;In this manner Spanish prestige was
preserved, inasmuch as it was no longer an Indian who asked for the
punishment of one belonging to a superior race, but a Spaniard who took
up the Indian&rsquo;s cause and conducted the suit against another
Spaniard.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4483src" href="#xd21e4483"
name="xd21e4483src">49</a> Thus it may be seen that in Spain&rsquo;s
judicial system the means were provided, in theory at least, whereby
the meanest native could obtain justice, not only among his fellows,
but in cases to which members of the superior Spanish race were
parties.</p>
<p>The declared purpose of the whole system of legislation for the
Indies was the material and spiritual well-being of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>Indians.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4493src"
href="#xd21e4493" name="xd21e4493src">50</a> The officials of the
government, the churchmen, and the <i lang="es">encomenderos</i> were
especially charged in their commissions and in official correspondence
to make the protection and welfare of the Indians their chief concern.
Attention has just been directed to the office of protector of the
Indians. The <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, or one of his assistants,
attended to that duty in the Audiencia of Manila, while agents
(<i lang="es">agentes fiscales</i>) were especially commissioned by the
<i lang="es">fiscal</i> to act in that capacity in the
provinces.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4511src" href="#xd21e4511" name=
"xd21e4511src">51</a> We have also noted that the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> were charged with the duty of protecting the Indians
when officiating as visitors in the provinces. Such cases, also those
involving decisions of <i lang="es">corregidores</i> and <i lang=
"es">alcaldes mayores</i> by which the natives were dealt with
unjustly, were appealable, under certain circumstances, to the
audiencia. These cases commanded the immediate attention of the
tribunal, to the exclusion of other business.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4535src" href="#xd21e4535" name="xd21e4535src">52</a> Among the
vast number of cases at our disposal which illustrate the jurisdiction
of the tribunal over such matters, the following may be selected as
typical. On May 16, 1796, the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> brought a charge
in the audiencia against the governor, exposing the sufferings
inflicted upon the Indians of the <i lang="es">barrio</i> of Santa Ana
by the <i lang="es">corregidor</i> of Tondo<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4550src" href="#xd21e4550" name="xd21e4550src">53</a> in
connection with the construction of a road. The audiencia refused to
consider the case in first instance, as the matter was not contentious,
but it recommended that the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> should make the
charges before the governor and have him render a decision upon the
matter; if exception were taken to his decision the case could be
appealed to the audiencia. The <i lang="es">oidores</i> found that they
were without <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>jurisdiction over the case in first instance and
they declared that their entertainment of the suit would be in
violation of the laws of the Indies.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4577src" href="#xd21e4577" name="xd21e4577src">54</a> The
<i lang="es">fiscal</i> appealed from the judgment of the audiencia.
The Council of the Indies, in a return communication dated May 13,
1798,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4588src" href="#xd21e4588" name=
"xd21e4588src">55</a> approved the ruling of the audiencia, affirming
that in cases of the nature referred to, the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>,
as protector of the Indians, should submit testimony in behalf of the
latter to the governor, who should consider whether the Indians had
been wronged and render his decision accordingly. If exception were
taken to the decision of the governor, the case could then be appealed
to the audiencia. While these appeals and this litigation were in
progress, the Indians were being subjected to repeated hardships.</p>
<p>This case is illustrative of the ineffectiveness of the system for
the administration of justice in Spain&rsquo;s colonies. It had taken
two years for this appeal to be carried to Spain and receive the
attention of the Council of the Indies. The answer had yet to be
returned, probably requiring at least a year more for the return of the
Vera Cruz and Acapulco galleons and for the proper proceedings to be
carried on in the Manila tribunal. It is questionable whether the
Indians in whose interests this was ultimately done ever received any
benefit from these legal proceedings.</p>
<p>The case which has just been described involved the trial and
punishment of a <i lang="es">corregidor</i> in the defense and
protection of the natives. It is important to note that this case was
ordered to be tried in first instance by the governor and not by the
audiencia. The jurisdiction of the latter tribunal in second instance
was confirmed by the king on this occasion. By the law of October 9,
1812, and by others made pursuant to the Constitution of 1812, the
audiencia was given jurisdiction in first <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>instance over cases
involving provincial officials, and particularly judges. In regard to
the care and protection of the Indians, which was involved in this
controversy, the law provided that such cases should be treated
originally by the <i lang="es">corregidores</i> and <i lang=
"es">alcaldes mayores</i> with appeal to the audiencia.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4612src" href="#xd21e4612" name=
"xd21e4612src">56</a> But this case dealt primarily with the official
conduct of a <i lang="es">corregidor</i>, over whom the governor had
more direct jurisdiction. The <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of May 13,
1798, which constituted the reply of the king to the appeal of the
<i lang="es">fiscal</i> in the case described above, ordered that
henceforth in cases affecting the relations of the <i lang=
"es">corregidores</i> and <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> on the one
part and the Indians on the other, the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>,
audiencia, and governor should act in <i lang="es">acuerdo</i>, in that
way avoiding friction and quarrels over jurisdiction.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4640src" href="#xd21e4640" name="xd21e4640src">57</a></p>
<p>That the audiencia did not always try cases relating to the Indians
with requisite promptness, is evidenced by the many and repeated
letters of the king to the tribunal, to the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, as
protector of the Indians, and to the regent, chiding these officials
for delay. On many occasions the royal zeal for justice in the
treatment of the Indians, based on a lack of knowledge of the true
nature of the Filipino, completely overruled all considerations of
practicability and common sense. As an illustration of this, on June
20, 1686, certain natives of the province of Bulac&aacute;n sent false
evidence to the Council of the Indies; this testimony was taken in
preference to that remitted by the audiencia, the decision of the
latter body being reversed by the Council of the Indies. The audiencia
refused to allow the execution of the new judgment; the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> all offered to resign in protest, and the regent, at
the risk of removal, reopened the case. It was proved by the testimony
of a number of officials and by the confessions <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>of
the natives who had perjured themselves that the evidence upon which
the Council had acted was false.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4665src"
href="#xd21e4665" name="xd21e4665src">58</a> A record of these
proceedings was remitted to the Council and that tribunal promptly
reversed its former decision.</p>
<p>Further illustrations of the authority of the audiencia in cases
involving natives may be seen in suits which arose from time to time
over the illegal treatment of the latter by the friars and the unjust
occupation of the natives&rsquo; lands by the religious orders. These
suits afford illustration, also, of the services of the audiencia as an
agency to force persons to show their titles to lands which they
held.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4673src" href="#xd21e4673" name=
"xd21e4673src">59</a> This jurisdiction will be given more detailed
treatment in the proper place, but the brief citation of one or two
cases among many seems advisable to illustrate the activity of the
audiencia in protecting the Indians, both by trying suits involving
them and by actually intervening in their behalf.</p>
<p>Various revolts broke out among the Indians near Manila from 1740 to
1750. These insurrections were said to have been provoked by the
encroachments of the Augustinians and Dominicans on the lands of the
natives. The matter was called to the attention of the home government,
and Pedro Calder&oacute;n Enr&iacute;quez, an <i lang="es">oidor</i>,
was ordered to investigate the charges made against these religious
orders and to ascertain the validity of their claims to the lands in
question. The friars, when ordered to submit titles to a secular judge,
refused to comply, claiming ecclesiastical exemption. In the face of
their opposition, Calder&oacute;n dispossessed the friars of the lands
which they were said <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104"
name="pb104">104</a>]</span>to have usurped and which they were
continuing to hold without legitimate title, restoring the lands to the
crown. The case was appealed to the audiencia and that tribunal upheld
the visitor.</p>
<p>Calder&oacute;n also found that the University of Santo Tom&aacute;s
and the Dominicans, in collusion with a clerk of the audiencia, had
taken lands from the native town of S&iacute;lang in 1743.
Calder&oacute;n restored the lands to their rightful owners and his act
was approved in judicial review by the audiencia. The friars took
exception to this by appealing to the Council of the Indies. The
Council notified the audiencia of its affirmation of the judgment of
Calder&oacute;n and further stated that the lands of S&iacute;lang,
Im&uacute;s, San Nicol&aacute;s, and Cavite had been unjustly seized
and should be restored. This was not only an affirmation but an
extension of the sentence of the <i lang="es">oidor</i>, made by the
Council after the royal <i lang="es">fiscal</i> (of the Council of the
Indies) had reviewed all the evidence presented in the case. This suit
shows the efforts made to carry out the royal intention that the
natives of Spain&rsquo;s colonies should be justly treated. It also
shows the respective jurisdictions of the audiencia and Council of the
Indies as courts of review and appeal in adjusting disputes between the
church and the Indians.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the audiencia exercised jurisdiction over
the religious themselves, both as individuals and as subjects of the
king, punishing them for violation of the civil laws of the realm to
which they were amenable as subjects. An illustration of this is
furnished by the following case which occurred in 1617. Two Augustinian
provincials were murdered, one, Fray Ger&oacute;nimo de Salas, by
poisoning, and his successor, Fray Vicente Sep&uacute;lveda, by
strangulation. A tribunal of friars, composed of nine prominent members
of the Augustinian order, was appointed by the bishop for the
investigation of the crime. This body, after due consideration, caused
six members of the order to be apprehended; four of them were believed
to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>guilty of the murder and two were suspected of
connivance at the crime. On July 31, 1617, these six culprits were
handed over to the civil government, and on September 2 of that year,
the four guilty ecclesiastics were condemned to death by the audiencia,
while the other two were sentenced to six years of service in the
galleys. This case illustrates the extent of ecclesiastical
jurisdiction exercised respectively by the church and government
tribunals under the <i lang="es">fuero mixto</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4702src" href="#xd21e4702" name="xd21e4702src">60</a> The former,
on this occasion, made the preliminary investigations and handed the
culprits over to the secular authority with recommendations; the latter
conducted the trial, passed sentence and saw to its execution. The
trial and conclusion of this case covered the remarkably short period
of thirty-three days.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4710src" href=
"#xd21e4710" name="xd21e4710src">61</a></p>
<p>Speaking generally, the authority of the audiencia over
ecclesiastical affairs extended to disputes between orders, between the
government and the church, or its representatives, to cases relating to
land titles, to those alleging abuses of the Indians by the friars, to
cases involving the royal patronage, and to cases of <i lang=
"es">fuerza</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4718src" href="#xd21e4718"
name="xd21e4718src">62</a> As the question of the ecclesiastical
jurisdiction of the audiencia will be discussed more fully in
subsequent chapters, no effort will be made at this time to
particularize concerning its authority over church affairs, it being
merely desirable to suggest the fact here that the audiencia had
jurisdiction in suits involving the church and the civil government and
in those which had to do with the protection of the natives from the
abuses of the ecclesiastics.</p>
<p>Records of thousands of cases exist to show the different
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>kinds of suits tried judicially in the
audiencia. Civil and criminal matters came up in the tribunal as in all
other courts of law, and hence, as such, merit only passing attention.
Among civil cases possibly the most typical were those relating to
<i lang="es">encomiendas</i>. It must be borne in mind that the
Spaniard, however mistakenly from the theoretical point of view,
regarded the <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> as property in the same sense
as a modern farmer regards his farm as property. He paid a rental or
tax to the government, he engaged in agriculture for gain, and, as we
have seen, the moral duty of protecting, uplifting, or educating the
Indians rested but lightly on his conscience. Therefore, as these cases
are discussed in the following pages, the value of the property and not
the treatment of the Indians on the <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> is the
first consideration. As already stated, the law of Malines reserved for
the Council of the Indies final action in all <i lang=
"es">encomienda</i> suits involving more than one thousand
ducats.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4740src" href="#xd21e4740" name=
"xd21e4740src">63</a></p>
<p>Many suits involving <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> came up prior to
the establishment of the audiencia; the defects apparent in the trial
of these cases by the governor show clearly the need of an audiencia at
that time. The earliest case noted in this connection was prosecuted in
1580 by the <i lang="es">asesor</i> of the governor against Do&ntilde;a
Luc&iacute;a de Loaxa, the widow of an <i lang="es">encomendero</i>,
with the object of dispossessing her of an <i lang="es">encomienda</i>
held at Butu&aacute;n, Mindanao.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4759src"
href="#xd21e4759" name="xd21e4759src">64</a> She was charged with
having nullified her title by marriage to another <i lang=
"es">encomendero</i>, since the law forbade married women to hold
<i lang="es">encomiendas</i>. In her defense she alleged that the
desire of the governor to enforce the law was only pretense, since many
married women in the Philippines held <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>She stated that the governor desired to deprive
her of her property in order that he might bestow it upon a friend.
This case was carried to the Council of the Indies, and it illustrates
the effectiveness of the law of Malines, which took from the governor
authority over a case in which he was interested and gave final
jurisdiction to the tribunal in Spain. The papers pertaining to this
case were returned to the governor with orders to do as the law
commanded. The defendant was accordingly removed from the <i lang=
"es">encomienda</i>.</p>
<p>Another case was disposed of in a slightly different manner. On
January 22, 1581, Juan Guti&eacute;rrez de Figueroa, second husband of
Magdalena Rodr&iacute;guez, widow of an <i lang="es">encomendero</i> of
Mindanao, filed suit before the governor praying to be continued as
possessor of an <i lang="es">encomienda</i> which his wife had held
prior to her marriage to him. He brought the suit on the grounds that
he was a soldier and was accordingly deserving of reward. This case, in
accordance with the provisions of Malines, came within the jurisdiction
of the governor. He denied the petition, but the soldier appealed the
case to the Council of the Indies and that tribunal again reversed the
decision of the governor on May 23, 1584.</p>
<p>In January, 1582, Bishop Salazar, as protector of the Indians,
brought suit before Governor Ronquillo de Pe&ntilde;alosa against Juan
de Ayala, a Spaniard holding various <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> in
different parts of the Island of Luz&oacute;n, but resident in Manila.
Two specific charges were brought against Ayala. He was said to have
reduced the Indians on his <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> to the status
of slaves, which was forbidden by the law of November 9, 1526.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4802src" href="#xd21e4802" name=
"xd21e4802src">65</a> He had also violated the law which prescribed
that <i lang="es">encomenderos</i> should live on their <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4814src" href=
"#xd21e4814" name="xd21e4814src">66</a> and give their personal
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>attention to the Indians thereon. Ayala adduced
testimony to prove that this law was a dead-letter and that it was
disregarded by most of the <i lang="es">encomenderos</i>. He even
showed that there were many of them residing in Spain who held <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i> in Spain and Per&uacute;. Governor Ronquillo felt
that the evidence at hand was insufficient to justify a decision in
this case, so he permitted it to be carried to the Council of the
Indies. The latter tribunal rendered its decision on June 24, 1584,
communicating to the Audiencia of Manila its ruling that Ayala should
be allowed to retain the <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> in question, but
the president and <i lang="es">oidores</i> were especially charged to
enforce the law prohibiting slavery in the Indies.</p>
<p>The procedure in these cases confirms the laws already alluded to,
which were promulgated before the establishment of the audiencia, that
the governor should have jurisdiction in suits involving less than a
thousand ducats, with appeal to the Council of the Indies. It would
also appear, from the data at our command, that the audiencia inherited
the governor&rsquo;s former authority in these matters.</p>
<p>During the period from 1583 to 1589, and after the re-establishment
of the audiencia in Manila, this tribunal exercised authority over
suits involving <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>. There is so much sameness
in the nature of these cases that little would be added by describing
them. There appears evidence of considerable conflict of jurisdiction,
however, between the governor and the audiencia over the adjustment of
the latter to the new situation relative to the <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i>. Governors Acu&ntilde;a, Tello and Fajardo sought
on various occasions to retain jurisdiction over suits involving
<i lang="es">encomiendas</i> on the basis of the law of Malines,
notwithstanding the fact that the audiencia had been given the duty of
trying such cases. When appeals were made to the Council of the Indies,
that tribunal made clear its determination that the audiencia should
try suits involving <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>, but that in
administrative matters relating thereto the will of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>the
governor should prevail, unless his decision were contested through
legal channels. An illustration of such difference of opinion may be
noted in the letter written by Governor Juan Ni&ntilde;o de Tavora on
August 4, 1628, to the Council of the Indies. Tavora complained of the
action of the audiencia in regard to the disposal of a case involving
an <i lang="es">encomendero</i> who had married the widow of another
<i lang="es">encomendero</i>, and who had tried to unite and hold both
their <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> after marriage. The governor
contended that two persons holding <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> by
previous right should choose the more desirable one and relinquish the
other, in accordance with the practice in other places. Especially
should this be done in the Philippines, he held, because there were so
few <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> in the Islands. The <i lang=
"es">fiscal</i> approved of this suggestion and made a motion before
the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> of the audiencia that this course should
be pursued, but, as no laws had been promulgated on the subject, there
was no precedent to follow. The audiencia accordingly declared that
such a course as the governor had suggested would not be legal. Tavora
petitioned the Council of the Indies for a ruling on the subject. The
Council sustained the governor in its <i lang="es">consulta</i> of
January 15, 1630.</p>
<p>There was apparently no limit to the value of suits involving
<i lang="es">encomiendas</i> which might be tried in the audiencia, and
appealed to the Council of the Indies. There exists the record of one
case in which the <i lang="es">encomienda</i> was valued at 223,000
pesos. In this suit the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> proceeded against
Do&ntilde;a Juana Leal and Francisco de Rebolledo, residents of Mexico,
for possession of an <i lang="es">encomienda</i> held in the
Philippines. This case affords an illustration of the delays to which
the course of justice was subject, it being appealed to the Council of
the Indies in 1612, and not finally settled till 1620. A suit involving
an <i lang="es">encomienda</i> valued at 430,102 pesos came before the
audiencia in 1703, when two residents of Manila, named Delgado and
Abaurrea, were dispossessed of an <i lang="es">encomienda</i> by the
governor. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>The <i lang="es">encomienda</i> was awarded
immediately to Juan de Echevarr&iacute;a and Antonio de Endaya. The
latter were prosecuted in the audiencia by the dispossessed <i lang=
"es">encomenderos</i>, and the tribunal, in compliance with the law of
Malines, made the prescribed investigation, recommending that the
governor&rsquo;s action should be disapproved, since the evidence
showed that the persons installed on the <i lang="es">encomienda</i>
were distant relatives of the governor. The Council adopted the
recommendations of the audiencia in this case, ordering that the
original <i lang="es">encomenderos</i> should be restored to their
estate, and that this breach of royal commands should be registered
against the governor to be answered in his <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>.</p>
<p>Another suit, of a similar nature to that described above, was
brought in the audiencia in 1713 against Juan de Rivas, who had been
assigned two <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> in Leyte and Ceb&uacute;,
respectively, by the governor, thus depriving one Saramiento who had
held them formerly. The plaintiff claimed that he had made great
improvements on these estates, spending all his income thereon, and as
yet had received no profits from the lands. He petitioned, therefore,
that these <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> should be bestowed upon him for
another term.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4925src" href="#xd21e4925"
name="xd21e4925src">67</a> The audiencia withheld its judgment on this
case, referring it to the Council. That body, after seeking the advice
of the royal <i lang="es">fiscal</i> and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb111" href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span><i lang=
"es">contador</i>, recommended to the king that Saramiento should be
allowed to retain the <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> for another term,
and it was accordingly done, a royal order to that effect being
expedited on May 29, 1715.</p>
<p>It is notable how frequently the action of the audiencia or that of
the governor was confirmed by the Council of the Indies. In most of the
cases which have been described, the original papers, including
letters, <i lang="es">autos</i> and <i lang="es">testimonios</i>, each
<i lang="es">expediente</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e4980src" href=
"#xd21e4980" name="xd21e4980src">68</a> containing from one hundred to
two thousand pages, are marked &ldquo;seen by the Council&rdquo;,
&ldquo;action of the governor confirmed&rdquo;, or &ldquo;no action to
be taken&rdquo;; the original decisions being thus confirmed. It may be
concluded, therefore, from this brief study that the audiencia had
appellate jurisdiction as a court of law over suits involving <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i>, and, furthermore, that the tribunal acting in
that capacity placed a very effective and definite check on the
governor in his executive control over <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i>.</p>
<p>Property suits, aside from those involving <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i>, were numerous. One noted case may be cited in
which the heirs of Governor Fausto Cruzat y G&oacute;ngora in 1703
brought suit to recover money owed by Gaspar S&aacute;nchez and
Bernardo de Guir&oacute;s to the ex-governor. The audiencia failed to
award the sum, which approximated 8000 pesos. The case was appealed to
the Council of the Indies and the decision was reversed, the plaintiffs
being awarded the money originally sued for, with costs <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>of
suit. A similar case was brought by the children and heirs of Governor
Bustamante against Juan de Nebra, <i lang="es">general</i> of the
galleon. The case was tried in the audiencia and the tribunal decided
in favor of the defendant. The case was appealed to the Council of the
Indies and the decision was reversed.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5026src" href="#xd21e5026" name="xd21e5026src">69</a> In 1736
Gaspar Thom&eacute;, a Frenchman, sued the estate of a deceased debtor,
Juan de Olerte, for 2000 pesos.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5033src"
href="#xd21e5033" name="xd21e5033src">70</a> The case was appealed to
the Council of the Indies, and fully two hundred pages of documentary
material exist, carefully annotated and digested,<a id="xd21e5040"
name="xd21e5040"></a> to show how thoroughly and with what formality a
suit of even that small import was tried. We have already noted the
tendency of the government to discourage the appeal of property suits
to the Council of the Indies. The jurisdiction of the audiencia was
final, for the most part, in suits involving sums from 200 to 6000
pesos.</p>
<p>As matters of trade were always important in the life and politics
of the Islands, commercial suits commanded a large share of the
attention of the audiencia. Up to 1769 the jurisdiction of the
audiencia was supreme in matters relating thereto,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5044src" href="#xd21e5044" name="xd21e5044src">71</a> but on
December 13 of that year a <i lang="es">consulado</i> was established
at Manila, thereby relieving the audiencia of much of its former
control over commercial affairs.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5053src"
href="#xd21e5053" name="xd21e5053src">72</a> The <i lang=
"es">consulado</i>, from the time of its establishment, was an
ever-present thorn in the side of the audiencia and conflicts over the
respective jurisdictions of the tribunals<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5062src" href="#xd21e5062" name="xd21e5062src">73</a> were
continually arising. We may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href=
"#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>briefly cite one or two cases to
illustrate the respective jurisdictions of the audiencia and the
tribunal of the <i lang="es">consulado</i>. On December 26, 1806,
action was brought by two Spaniards against the British firm of Jacob
Smith and Company on account of the inferior quality of goods sold to
the plaintiff by that firm.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5097src" href=
"#xd21e5097" name="xd21e5097src">74</a> Suit was brought originally in
the audiencia, but the <i lang="es">consulado</i> applied to the
governor for jurisdiction in the case on the ground that, as a
commercial suit, it should be tried in the <i lang=
"es">consulado</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5106src" href=
"#xd21e5106" name="xd21e5106src">75</a> The governor awarded
jurisdiction to the audiencia. The <i lang="es">consulado</i>
re-appealed the case, but the Council sustained the governor&rsquo;s
decision on the ground that this was a suit between a private
individual and a merchant which should be tried in the audiencia, the
tribunal which usually tried cases between individuals. The function of
the <i lang="es">consulado</i>, the royal decree stated, was to try
suits of a commercial character which arose between merchants.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5118src" href="#xd21e5118" name=
"xd21e5118src">76</a></p>
<p>An occasion on which the jurisdiction of the audiencia was
unquestioned may be noted in the suit which was appealed to the Council
of the Indies from the audiencia in 1698, over the wrecking of the
galleon &ldquo;San Francisco Xavier&rdquo;. The admiral, Don Esteban
Ramos, was held accountable for the silver carried on the ship and the
merchants of Manila sued him for what they had lost in the
wreck.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5128src" href="#xd21e5128" name=
"xd21e5128src">77</a> It was charged that Ramos had landed the silver,
but was seeking to conceal that fact, claiming instead that it was
lost. The case was appealed to the Council by the defendant.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5131src" href="#xd21e5131" name=
"xd21e5131src">78</a> The Council referred the case to the <i lang=
"es">Junta <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>de Guerra</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5143src" href="#xd21e5143" name="xd21e5143src">79</a> and that
tribunal reversed the decision of the audiencia, declaring that Ramos
was a faithful servant of His Majesty, and still a poor man. There was
no possibility of his having the silver. Ramos was transferred to the
Atlantic <i>flota</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5156src" href=
"#xd21e5156" name="xd21e5156src">80</a> The royal <i lang=
"es">fiscal</i>, in the opinion rendered for the guidance of the
<i lang="es">junta</i>, made the comment that frequently the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> of colonial audiencias were influenced, against their
own ideas of justice, by the opinions and wishes of the most powerful
residents. Such was possibly the case in Manila on this occasion. This
statement at least shows that those in control at Madrid were aware of
some of the fundamental weaknesses of the colonial audiencias.</p>
<p>Another typical case, indirectly connected with commerce, occurred
in 1713, when the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> of the audiencia prosecuted
three captains, Enrique Boynont, Fernando Gall and Diego Brunet, who
had arrived at Cavite in command of French merchant and exploring
ships, without the royal permission to trade in the Islands. These
captains, who were foreigners, of course, were charged with smuggling,
and were brought before the royal audiencia. The charges against them
were not proved, and in due time the cases were dismissed.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5177src" href="#xd21e5177" name=
"xd21e5177src">81</a> The laws of the Indies authorized the governor
and the <i lang="es">alcaldes del crimen</i> to try cases of
strangers,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5184src" href="#xd21e5184" name=
"xd21e5184src">82</a> but in Manila, where there were no magistrates of
this category, such cases were tried by the audiencia.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important commercial suit that was ever
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>tried in the Audiencia of Manila, came before
that tribunal in 1656, when several residents of Mexico were excluded
from the use of the galleon and their goods confiscated. This action
was in accordance with repeated <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> and
regulations which reserved the space in the galleon for the exclusive
use of the Manila merchants and authorities. Mexican traders, who had
from time to time shipped goods on the galleons, were forbidden to
crowd out the Manila merchants, who depended on that trade exclusively.
The fine levied on this occasion amounted to 273,133 pesos. The case
was appealed to the Council of the Indies, the aforesaid decision was
upheld, and the sum was finally ordered paid in Mexico.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5196src" href="#xd21e5196" name=
"xd21e5196src">83</a></p>
<p>During the greater part of the audiencia&rsquo;s existence there was
no <i lang="es">consulado</i> in Manila and the jurisdiction of the
audiencia in commercial cases extended to suits between merchants for
space on the galleon. The tribunal had jurisdiction over the trial of
officials for dishonesty in the assignment of galleon space:
investigations of officials charged with reserving more than their due
share of space, and such other cases as are mentioned in the laws of
the Indies as being the concern of the <i lang="es">consulados</i> of
Lima and Mexico.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5212src" href="#xd21e5212"
name="xd21e5212src">84</a> Officers of the galleons were tried for
mistreating seamen, for smuggling, for exceeding the limit of
merchandise allowed, for giving passage to lewd women and to persons
travelling on the galleons without permission. They were tried for
carrying more slaves than they were allowed by law to carry, for
charging exorbitant prices of passage, and for failing to turn in
accounts of money collected. Commanders were often held criminally
responsible for carelessness in navigation and for shipwrecks. These
cases were tried in the tribunal of the <i lang="es">consulado</i>
after 1769. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span></p>
<p>The audiencia had appellate jurisdiction over all residents of the
colony, both natives and Spaniards. All crimes committed within five
leagues of the city of Manila were ordered to be tried by the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> in first instance,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5226src"
href="#xd21e5226" name="xd21e5226src">85</a> but unless they were of
extraordinary importance, special investigators, usually <i lang=
"es">alcaldes mayores</i> or <i lang="es">alcaldes ordinarios</i>, were
delegated to try them in the name of the audiencia.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5237src" href="#xd21e5237" name="xd21e5237src">86</a> As
already stated, most of the criminal cases arising in the colony were
tried in first instance in the provinces by the <i lang="es">alcaldes
mayores</i>. Cases appealed to the audiencia were reviewed in that
tribunal. The trial consisted of an examination of the summary or
abstract of the case as it was originally tried by the lower judge and,
if errors were found to exist, the decision was either reversed or the
case was remanded to the judge who first had tried the case, for second
trial.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5246src" href="#xd21e5246" name=
"xd21e5246src">87</a> The audiencia did not try the case with the
defendant present. It merely reviewed the proceedings of the lower
judge. Criminal cases were not ordinarily appealable to the Council of
the Indies.</p>
<p>The procedure in criminal cases was generally so similar to that
already described that it is unnecessary to give any illustration of
the audiencia&rsquo;s criminal jurisdiction. Most of the cases that
eventually reached the audiencia involved Spaniards, native <i lang=
"es">caciques</i>, and half-castes. Natives who were charged with
robbery, murder, and crimes of a depraved nature were usually of a
class unable to finance appeals to the audiencia. This fact probably
accounts for the scarcity of criminal cases appealed during the first
two centuries of the audiencia&rsquo;s existence.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5260src" href="#xd21e5260" name="xd21e5260src">88</a> However,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>the reforms of the nineteenth century brought an
increased number of cases into the audiencia by systematizing the
administration of justice, differentiating the judgeships from
administrative offices, and providing for greater facility of
appeal.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5372src" href="#xd21e5372" name=
"xd21e5372src">89</a></p>
<p>It is probable that in criminal as well as in civil cases, Spaniards
derived considerable benefit from the fact that the audiencia was
composed of magistrates of their own nationality. High officials, no
doubt, escaped the consequences of their misdeeds more easily than did
men of more modest social and political attainments. This is shown by
the well-known case of the murder by Governor Fajardo of his wife on
July 21, 1621; this came up before an audiencia which was composed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>of judges who were largely under the
governor&rsquo;s domination. The tribunal gave the matter a cursory
investigation, after which the governor was allowed to go
unpunished.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5408src" href="#xd21e5408" name=
"xd21e5408src">90</a> We shall see that proceedings were different,
however, when officials under investigation were charged with offenses
against the government. The <i lang="es">residencia</i>, which dealt
with such charges, was a pitiless form of inquisition in which the
officiating magistrate was in duty bound to find his victim guilty, if
possible.</p>
<p>Criminal cases of a character slightly different from those
described above were prosecuted by the government for the infraction of
any governmental regulation, or for the evasion of the payment of taxes
or duties. The collection of revenues devolved upon the <i lang=
"es">oficiales reales</i> and they were ordered to accomplish their
duties in this particular, if possible, without the assistance of the
courts.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5420src" href="#xd21e5420" name=
"xd21e5420src">91</a> Numerous cases did come up in the audiencia,
however, involving the prosecution of individuals for violations of the
<i lang="es">alcabala</i>, <i lang="es">quinto</i>, and the tax on the
export of silver (<i lang="es">comisos</i>). Persons assisting in the
apprehension of violators of these laws were rewarded with a part of
the proceeds of the fine, the remainder becoming the property of
<i lang="es">real hacienda</i>. On October 6, 1783, the final
jurisdiction in cases of smuggling and non-payment of the king&rsquo;s
fifth was taken from the audiencia, appeals being authorized to the
Council of the Indies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5438src" href=
"#xd21e5438" name="xd21e5438src">92</a></p>
<p>Reference has already been made to the services of an <i lang=
"es">oidor</i> as special <i lang="es">auditor de guerra</i>. This, as
well as other matters relating to the jurisdiction of the governor and
captain-general over military matters, wherein the audiencia had no
authority, will be noted when an examination is made of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>relations of the governor and audiencia in a
subsequent chapter. Suffice it to say here that the audiencia did not
have jurisdiction as a court over soldiers or military affairs.</p>
<p>Closely related to the subject of the defense of the Islands, and
the exercise of judicial authority over soldiers was the special
jurisdiction which the governor had over matters relating to the
Chinese. This subject will be treated in greater detail when we discuss
the relations of the audiencia and the governor.</p>
<p>During the first two centuries of its existence the audiencia had
jurisdiction as a judicial tribunal in the cases and instances which
have been noted. It had civil and criminal authority, original and
appellate. Its decisions were final in civil suits on claims for six
thousand pesos or less. Criminal cases were settled in the
audiencia.</p>
<p>The judicial authority of the audiencia was impeded during the
greater part of its history by the failure of the government to entrust
it with complete jurisdiction in all civil and criminal matters, and by
the tendency of the latter to interfere in matters of minute and
insignificant detail, which should have been left to the magistrates of
the tribunal. The Constitution of 1812 and the reforms made in
pursuance thereof really effected the changes which had long been
needed. The audiencia&rsquo;s jurisdiction was made final in all civil
suits and increased in administrative cases; thereafter no appeals were
made to the Council of the Indies unless they involved administrative
law. Cases involving official dishonesty, incapacity, <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>, <i lang="es">pesquisas</i>, treason, disputes
between audiencias and other tribunals over conflicts of jurisdiction,
and questions of the interpretation of the law were still carried to
Spain. These were important steps for the improvement of colonial
judicial procedure; they served to simplify it, preventing a
multiplicity of cases from being carried to Spain which should have
been settled within the colony. These tardy reforms left <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>to
the home government more time in which to occupy itself with questions
of governmental policy, leaving to the audiencias more authority and
responsibility in purely judicial matters, thus giving to them a
greater prestige in the commonwealths wherein they were situated.</p>
<p>The qualifications for the magistracy were also raised at this time,
although it cannot be said that the magistrates of the audiencias were
at any time incompetent or lacking in ability. The audiencias of the
colonies were given equal status with those of the Peninsula, and were
thus elevated in dignity and standing to the rank of tribunals of the
first order. The chief defects of the colonial judicial system of the
seventeenth century were thus corrected, though somewhat tardily. It is
unfortunate indeed that these changes applied only to a mere skeleton
of Spain&rsquo;s former colonial empire.</p>
<p>In this chapter we have discussed the audiencia as a formal court of
justice, with methods, practices, and traditions little different from
those of any tribunal of justice. However, it had judicial authority
more extensive and far-reaching than has yet been indicated. Among the
different kinds of cases over which the audiencia had jurisdiction,
perhaps none was more important, and certainly none was more
exclusively peculiar to the Spanish judicial system than suits of
<i lang="es">residencia</i>. So distinct and extraordinary was that
phase of judicial activity that it merits consideration apart from a
discussion of the audiencia&rsquo;s functions as an ordinary court of
law. In the following section we shall note its jurisdiction as an
administrative court over suits wherein the government was a party and
wherein the object was not only to punish offenders, but to act as a
preventive of official misconduct. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121"

<i>Ibid.</i>, 133 (1563). Helps (<i>Spanish conquest</i>, I, 102,
103&ndash;104) states that the <i lang="es">repartimiento</i> system
was originated in 1496, from the requirement of Columbus that the
natives of Hispaniola should pay him a certain quantity of gold as
tribute. In view of the inability of the natives to meet the demands of
the Spaniards in regard to the precious metal, &ldquo;the villagers
were ordered to make (and work) the farms in the Spanish settlements.
This may be considered as the beginning of the system of <i lang=
"es">repartimientos</i>, or <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>, as they were
afterwards called.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote">In a subsequent chapter the same author tells of
the difficulty which Ovando had in compelling the Indians to live among
the Spaniards, to pay tribute and accept religious teaching. Ferdinand
and Isabella, in a letter dated December 20, 1503, directed Ovando to
compel the Indians to deal with the Spaniards, to work for wages, to go
to mass, to be instructed in the faith, and further, that they should
do all these things &ldquo;as free persons, for so they are.&rdquo; ...
&ldquo;Ovando adopted the following system,&rdquo; says Helps;
&ldquo;he distributed Indians amongst the Castillians, giving to one
man fifty, to another a hundred; with a deed that ran thus: &lsquo;to
you, such a one, is given an <i lang="es">encomienda</i> of so many
Indians, with such a Cacique, and you are to teach them the things of
our Holy Catholic Faith&rsquo;. The word <i lang="es">encomienda</i>
... was a term belonging to the military orders, corresponding to our
commandery or preceptory; and this term naturally enough came into use
with the appointment, as governors in the Indies, of men, who held
authority in those orders, such as Bobadilla and Ovando.&rdquo; (See
also Bancroft, <i>History of Central America</i>, I, 262.) &ldquo;With
respect to the implied condition of teaching the Indians &lsquo;the
Holy Catholic Faith&rsquo; it was no more attended to from the first
than any formal clause in a deed, which is supposed by the parties
concerned to be a mere formality.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;We have now arrived,&rdquo; continues Helps,
&ldquo;at the climax of the <i lang="es">repartimiento</i> system. That
which Bobadilla did illegally, was now done with proper formalities on
parchment: ... We may notice again that the first <i lang=
"es">repartimientos</i> made by Columbus ... apportioned to any
Spaniard, whom he thought fit, such and such lands, to be worked by
such a Cacique and his people&mdash;a very different procedure to

6&ndash;19&ndash;6) authorized the governor of the Philippines to
assign <i lang="es">encomiendas ad interim</i> for the period of six
years (promulgated August 25, 1646). By the laws of May 1, 1774, and
June 8, 1792, the period was made five years in all the colonies except
Per&uacute;; in the latter it was six years (note to <i lang=
"es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>, 8&ndash;22&ndash;1). We have record of
the extension of an <i lang="es">encomienda</i> in the Philippines to
the Hospital of San Juan de Di&oacute;s for four years by Governor
Marquina on July 10, 1789. The <i lang="es">cofrad&iacute;a</i> had
held this <i lang="es">encomienda</i> for ten years, and on its
petition the governor made this additional concession, subject to royal
confirmation (A. I., 107&ndash;5&ndash;18). The above episode is at
variance with the statement of Bancroft (<i>History of Central
America</i>, I, 264) that the <i lang="es">encomienda</i> system came
to an end in 1721. Helps states that the <i lang="es">encomienda</i>
system &ldquo;remained in full force until the reign of Charles The
Third of Spain, at which period, it appears, it was
annulled.&rdquo;&mdash;See Helps <i>Spanish conquest</i>, IV, 240.</p>

CXXVI</i>, 59, 60) the Audiencia of Lima decided 89 civil cases on
appeal from February 11, 1788, to January 5, 1789. At the end of this
period there were 122 cases waiting on the docket. In the chamber of
first instance of the same audiencia 72 cases were tried and 124
remained to be tried at the end of approximately the same period. In
the criminal <i lang="es">sala</i> during the year 1788, there were 7
death sentences rendered, 16 sentences for robbery, 14 cases tried
involving personal injury, 15 for carrying arms in face of the
prohibition of the law, and 6 cases of adultery. The magistrates
excused themselves for this rather contemptible showing by alleging
that the membership of the tribunal had not been complete, to which the
king made answer that there would have been sufficient judges had not
the latter continually absented themselves on the smallest pretexts.
The charge of indolence was also frequently brought against the
magistrates of the Audiencia of Manila.</p>

<h2 class="main">JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE AUDIENCIA; THE
RESIDENCIA<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5480src" href="#xd21e5480" name=
"xd21e5480src">1</a></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The purpose of the <i lang="es">residencia</i> was to
uphold the morale of colonial service by making officials answer for
all their acts in a judicial examination held at the close of their
terms. It may be said that the fear of the <i lang="es">residencia</i>
was almost the sole incentive to righteous official conduct or
efficient public service, and it will be seen that the audiencia
exercised very pronounced authority in this. Indeed, the audiencia had
general supervision in a semi-judicial capacity over the services of
officials and public servants in the colonies. It was the function of
the audiencia to send reports to the court relative to the conduct,
work, or attitude of any employee or official of the government, or of
any resident of the colony. These reports were known as <i lang=
"es">informaciones (pareceres) de servicio</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5498src" href="#xd21e5498" name="xd21e5498src">2</a> The tribunal
itself was ready at all times to hear complaints against provincial
governors and judges, treasury officials, magistrates, governors, or,
in fact, any and all officials holding their positions by virtue of the
king&rsquo;s commission.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5503src" href=
"#xd21e5503" name="xd21e5503src">3</a> Charges might be made by a
wronged party or by anyone whose knowledge of an abuse was sufficient
to justify charges. Heavy penalties were imposed upon persons making
false or unsubstantiated charges.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5509src"
href="#xd21e5509" name="xd21e5509src">4</a> Complaints against <i lang=
"es">alcaldes mayores</i> and <i lang="es">corregidores</i> were most
likely to be made during the regular investigation of the visiting
<i lang="es">oidor</i>, which, as we have noted, occurred every three
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>years, but sufficient complaint might be made to
justify the dispatch of a special investigator at any time.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5525src" href="#xd21e5525" name=
"xd21e5525src">5</a></p>
<p>The findings of the above inspections might be reviewed by the
audiencia and lead to the suspension and dismissal of the official
under investigation.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5532src" href=
"#xd21e5532" name="xd21e5532src">6</a> The final action had to be
confirmed by the Council of the Indies in case the person concerned
were a royal appointee, but in these matters the action of the local
officials was usually approved. For the removal of <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> and <i lang="es">oficiales reales</i> a slightly
different method was pursued. A magistrate of the audiencia was
designated to investigate the case, the evidence was submitted to the
Council of the Indies and final action was taken by it and not by the
audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5543src" href="#xd21e5543" name=
"xd21e5543src">7</a> Any and all charges brought against an official in
these investigations, even though he were cleared at the time, might be
revived in the <i lang="es">residencia</i>.</p>
<p>Suspensions from office were made by the governor with the advice
and consent of the audiencia. The governor had the legal right to make
temporary removals, but on account of the seriousness of such an act,
and the considerations depending upon it, he usually preferred to have
the support of the magistrates in the matter. The governor, as
vicepatron, could suspend prelates and other church officials, but he
seldom, if ever, exercised his powers to the full extent. The audiencia
at Manila, on the other hand, actually drove the archbishop from the
city on various occasions. The suspension and the removal of members of
the ordinary clergy from their districts was a frequent occurrence, but
churchmen were not subject to <i lang="es">residencia</i>. The
audiencia had no authority to suspend or remove the governor, though
the magistrates could and frequently did bring charges against the
governor which led to his dismissal. Governors actually suspended and
removed <i lang="es">oidores</i> at <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>times, though such
acts were protested as violations of the law which authorized only the
Council of the Indies to remove these officials.</p>
<p>Briefly, the procedure in making these removals was as follows: the
governor and audiencia investigated the conduct of an official whenever
circumstances demanded it; the latter was either suspended and
recommended for removal, such recommendations being made by the
audiencia to the governor or to the Council of the Indies, according to
the rank of the official, or the tribunal could make the removal
itself.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5563src" href="#xd21e5563" name=
"xd21e5563src">8</a> If exception to the action of the audiencia were
taken, all the papers relative to the case were forwarded to the
Council of the Indies, and if good reasons were found to exist for the
action of the lower court the Council approved its action.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5568src" href="#xd21e5568" name="xd21e5568src">9</a>
This, was not the <i lang="es">residencia</i> as usually
considered.</p>
<p>Of the various authorities at our disposal, Bancroft gives the most
acceptable characterization of the <i lang="es">residencia</i>. He
defines it as an examination held, or an account taken, of the official
acts of an executive or judicial official within the province of his
jurisdiction during the term of his incumbency. This, Bancroft says,
was done at the expiration of the term of office or at stated periods,
or, in case of malfeasance, at any time.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5581src" href="#xd21e5581" name="xd21e5581src">10</a> The
principle underlying the institution of the <i lang="es">residencia</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>was bequeathed to the Spaniards by the Romans,
being similar to and probably derived from their law which gave the
right of accusation to any Roman citizen against an office-holder. The
<i lang="es">residencia</i> was conducted by a judicial official, and
it combined the features of a general survey of the career of the
official under investigation, an auditing of his accounts and a formal
trial. Its purpose was to ascertain whether or not the official had
faithfully executed his duties and it served to clear him if he were
proved honest, giving him a clean certificate of recommendation. If he
were found guilty of official misconduct or dishonesty he was
apprehended, degraded, and punished, according to his deserts.</p>
<p>Professor Bourne has written in regard to the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The <i lang="es">residencia</i> ... was an institution
peculiar in modern times of the Spanish colonial system. It was
designed to provide a method by which officials could be held to strict
accountability for all acts during their term of office.... To allow a
contest in the courts involving the governor&rsquo;s powers during his
term of office would be subversive of his authority. He was then to be
kept in bounds by realizing that a day of judgment was impending, when
everyone, even the poorest Indian, might in perfect security bring
forward his accusation. In the Philippines the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> for a governor lasted six months and was conducted
by his successor and all the charges made were forwarded to Spain....
The Italian traveller Gemelli Careri who visited Manila in 1696
characterizes the governor&rsquo;s <i lang="es">residencia</i> as a
&ldquo;dreadful Trial&rdquo;, the strain of which would sometimes
&ldquo;break their hearts.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Professor Bourne stated that it was the opinion of De Pons that
&ldquo;the severities of the <i lang="es">residencia</i> could be
mitigated, and no doubt such was the case in the Philippines. By the
end of the eighteenth century the <i lang="es">residencia</i> seems to
have lost its efficacy.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5637src"
href="#xd21e5637" name="xd21e5637src">11</a></p>
<p>It is important to note at the outset that the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> was not conducted periodically alone, but that it
might be held at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125"
name="pb125">125</a>]</span>any time in the career of an official. The
term <i lang="es">pesquisa</i> was applied to the form of <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> which was carried out by a special investigator
(<i lang="es">pesquisidor</i>), sent when serious charges were made
against the conduct of an official.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5666src"
href="#xd21e5666" name="xd21e5666src">12</a> In the investigation which
took place the official might be fined, or if grave offenses were
proved, he might be removed from office. Appeals might be made from the
<i lang="es">pesquisidor</i> to the audiencia and to the Council of the
Indies. In fact, the judgments of the <i lang="es">pesquisidor</i> were
always reviewed in the local tribunal unless the investigating judge
had been commissioned by the Council of the Indies.</p>
<p>The distinction which has been made here between the formal <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> which occurred at the close of the term of office
and the <i lang="es">pesquisa</i> which might take place whenever
serious charges were made, was first emphasized in laws promulgated by
Charles V in 1538, and by Philip II in 1591; these aimed to put a stop
to the excesses of certain governors, <i lang="es">corregidores</i>,
and ministers of justice, who, relying on the practice then prevailing
of taking <i lang="es">residencias</i> only at the close of the
official term, had committed unlimited excesses. The new laws, above
referred to, stated that although it had never been the royal wish that
<i lang="es">residencias</i> of royal appointees should be taken
without notice having been sent first to the monarch, the above
circumstances had made it necessary for them to be taken when charges
were made. This <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i>, therefore, authorized
the taking of <i lang="es">residencias</i> whenever the best interests
of the service required it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5701src" href=
"#xd21e5701" name="xd21e5701src">13</a></p>
<p>This <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> was followed by another which
forbade the sending of special investigators or judges of <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> against governors of provinces, unless persons of
responsible character presented charges against them, giving bonds to
cover the costs. An investigator was thereupon sent to conduct the
trial of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>official under examination.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5717src" href="#xd21e5717" name="xd21e5717src">14</a> This
matter is covered in slightly different terms in the law of June 19,
1620. According to that enactment, a <i lang="es">receptor</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5724src" href="#xd21e5724" name=
"xd21e5724src">15</a> might be sent to conduct the preliminary
investigations of <i lang="es">corregidores</i> and ordinary justices
when these demanded instant attention and could not await the formal
<i lang="es">residencia</i>. If, as a result of this inquiry, the guilt
of the official seemed apparent, a more complete investigation was made
by a judge appointed by the president and audiencia in <i lang=
"es">acuerdo</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5743src" href="#xd21e5743"
name="xd21e5743src">16</a></p>
<p>The authority to determine whether cases merited investigation or
not and whether an inquiry should be made, belonged to the <i lang=
"es">acuerdo</i>, while the designation of the judge rested with the
governor.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5753src" href="#xd21e5753" name=
"xd21e5753src">17</a> The judges sent on these missions were not at
first authorized to pass final sentence, their decisions being subject
to review in the audiencia before execution. However, by the law of May
5, 1576, this added authority was bestowed upon the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> who conducted special investigations, or <i lang=
"es">residencias</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5764src" href=
"#xd21e5764" name="xd21e5764src">18</a> Appeals might be made to the
audiencia and, if the sentence imposed the death penalty or permanent
removal from office, the appeal might be carried to the Council of the
Indies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5770src" href="#xd21e5770" name=
"xd21e5770src">19</a> The final approval of the Council was required
before action could be taken with regard to any royal appointee, except
in those cases wherein the fine did not exceed one thousand
pesos.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5775src" href="#xd21e5775" name=
"xd21e5775src">20</a></p>
<p>The <i lang="es">oidores</i>, it seems, did not always act as
impartial judges when entrusted with these investigations; they were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>often influenced by the extra reward obtained
for these services, and frequently by prejudice against the officials
under investigation. Such were the charges implied by Governor Fajardo
in 1619 when he wrote:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">It is always to be believed that the auditors
(<i lang="es">oidores</i>) to whom the inquiries are entrusted, ought
to make them, not only as judges, but as interested parties, so that
sinister inquiries should not be sent to your Majesty&rsquo;s royal
Council to defraud your royal treasury and the merits of those who have
served well<span class="corr" id="xd21e5793" title="Source: ,">.</span>
I assure your Majesty that I have heard that many inquiries have been
made with less justification than might be advisable.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5796src" href="#xd21e5796" name="xd21e5796src">21</a></p>
</div>
<p>A typical illustration of the jurisdiction of the audiencia in an
investigation of this sort, and of the delay to which the minor
officials were subjected, is shown in the case of Antonio Pimentel,
governor of the Marianas,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5801src" href=
"#xd21e5801" name="xd21e5801src">22</a> whose <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> was taken in the decade following 1711. In this
case may be seen the distinction between the formal <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>, conducted at the close of the regular term of
office, and an investigation of charges brought during the incumbency
of the official. This case illustrates both forms of investigation, for
it originated in a charge of treason brought against Pimentel, who, it
was said, had furnished food and water to the crews of two English
vessels, enemies of Spain, and subsequently these same ships had
captured the galleon, &ldquo;Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la
Encarnaci&oacute;n&rdquo;. The conduct of the case was given to
magistrate Torralba, who, on his arrival at Guam, sent Pimentel in
chains to Manila. Notwithstanding his defense of ignorance of a state
of war existing between Spain and England, he was sentenced to the
forfeiture of the bonds which he had posted on assuming office, and in
addition was deprived of his position as governor at Guam. This
sentence was rendered January 23, 1712, and was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>approved by the audiencia in review on July 24,
1714.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5812src" href="#xd21e5812" name=
"xd21e5812src">23</a> The tribunal sentenced Pimentel to prison and
ordered that his <i lang="es">residencia</i> should be taken;
accordingly, an examination was made of all his official acts as
governor. Pimentel, therefore, had not only to stand investigation for
the particular act which had brought about his removal, but he was also
subjected to a <i lang="es">residencia</i> covering his entire career
as governor. It may be noted that the two forms of investigation were
separate and distinct on this occasion.</p>
<p>Owing to the death of Governor Liz&aacute;rraga, to the imprisonment
of Oidor Villa, and to the state of anarchy surrounding the
administration of Torralba as governor, Pimentel was forced to languish
in prison several years while he waited <i lang="es">residencia</i>.
The appointment of Lu&iacute;s de Tagle as his successor and judge of
<i lang="es">residencia</i> was dated June 25, 1717. This occasion was
one on which the successor of a governor took his predecessor&rsquo;s
<i lang="es">residencia</i>, owing, the commission said, to the
distance and the irregularity of communication between Manila and Guam.
A letter of the audiencia, dated August 9, 1718, advised the governor
that there were 427 unfinished cases on the docket of the tribunal, and
chief among those that ought to be decided without delay was the review
of the <i lang="es">residencia</i> of Pimentel; it was added that there
seemed to be no prospect that a boat could get to Guam before 1719. The
record of the termination of this case probably reposes somewhere in
the archives, tied in an aged, yellow packet, bound by Spanish red
tape.</p>
<p>In summary, it may be said that there were two kinds of
investigations of official conduct, one taken at the completion of the
regular term of office and the other at any time when the needs of the
service required it. They both had the same ultimate purpose of holding
officials responsible for misconduct <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>in office, of giving
to all persons an opportunity of having justice done to them and of
deterring office-holders from future misdeeds.</p>
<p>Practically all of the colonial officials were subject to <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>. The most sensational and widely known <i lang=
"es">residencias</i> were, of course, those of viceroys and
captains-general, but <i lang="es">oidores</i>, treasury officials,
<i lang="es">encomenderos</i>, <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i>,
<i lang="es">corregidores</i>, admirals, generals, captains, and
constructors of galleons were likewise examined in this way.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5863src" href="#xd21e5863" name=
"xd21e5863src">24</a> The visitors and special investigators who were
sent to examine the government of the provinces and the state of the
Indians on the <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> were also subject to
<i lang="es">residencia</i>. <i lang="es">Residencias</i> were exacted
of all minor officials at the same time that their superiors were
examined.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5877src" href="#xd21e5877" name=
"xd21e5877src">25</a> Clerks, notaries, secretaries, <i lang=
"es">alcaldes ordinarios</i>, <i lang="es">regidores</i>, and other
officials of a minor category were investigated at the same time that
the governor was examined, an <i lang="es">alcalde</i> or an <i lang=
"es">oidor</i> being delegated by the new president to review their
official conduct. The examination of these minor officials seems to
have become more and more perfunctory and there was a tendency during
the latter part of the nineteenth century to continue them in office,
even without investigation. When, for instance, Governors Basco y
Vargas and Marquina gave up their offices this formality was
omitted.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5895src" href="#xd21e5895" name=
"xd21e5895src">26</a> The practice of taking the <i lang=
"es">residencias</i> of minor officials was definitely abandoned on
August 24, 1799, and a rigid inspection by the audiencia of their
official acts was authorized.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5905src" href=
"#xd21e5905" name="xd21e5905src">27</a></p>
<p>Much contradictory legislation appears in the laws of the Indies
relative to the method of taking <i lang="es">residencias</i>; this due
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>the reforms made from time to time. These laws
were formulated for a growing empire. A chronological review of them
will show that the <i lang="es">residencia</i> was at first more or
less of an experiment. Indeed, all the colonial institutions were in
the early periods passing through an experimental stage and these
seemingly contradictory laws were promulgated or repealed, according to
their success or failure when put into effect. Whenever, therefore, two
laws appear to be in conflict, the one of later date will be found to
supersede and repeal the earlier one.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5929src" href="#xd21e5929" name="xd21e5929src">28</a> In
illustration of this characteristic of the laws of the Indies we may
note the following example: The <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>December 4, 1630, ordered that the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> of the governor should be taken by his successor.
This law was seldom, if ever, observed. Owing to the distance from
Spain and New Spain, and the consequent length of time consumed in
voyages, to the unhealthful climate, and to the dangerous military
campaigns in which the governors were compelled to engage, death
frequently intervened before the successor of a governor arrived. These
conditions (which were characteristic of all of Spain&rsquo;s colonies)
did not prevent the <i lang="es">residencia</i> from being taken, but
caused the law to be modified by the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of
December 28, 1667, according to which judges for the <i lang=
"es">residencias</i> of viceroys and presidents-governor and
captains-general were to be designated by the court. The period of four
months, which had been authorized for the taking of <i lang=
"es">residencias</i> by the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of August
30, 1582, was extended to six months.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5972src" href="#xd21e5972" name="xd21e5972src">29</a> A change
was necessary, the new law declared, in order to put a stop to the
incessant strife, and the malice which had been shown by viceroys,
governors, and ministers in the taking of <i lang="es">residencias</i>.
The king determined that henceforth the judge of <i lang=
"es">residencias</i> should be designated by the court. The magistrate
usually named was the <i lang="es">decano</i>. After 1776 the regent
almost invariably conducted these investigations. The important reform
of August 24, 1799, ordered that judges of <i lang="es">residencia</i>
for governors, viceroys, presidents, governors-intendant,
corregidor-intendants, and presidents of the Council of the Indies
should be appointed by the king.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5990src"
href="#xd21e5990" name="xd21e5990src">30</a></p>
<p>The first <i lang="es">residencia</i> to be conducted in the
Philippines in accordance with the new law of November 28, 1667, was
that of Governor Salcedo, in 1670. This governor had been removed by
the commissary of the Inquisition on October 10, 1668, and Francisco
Coloma, the <i lang="es">decano</i>, was ordered to take his <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6009src" href=
"#xd21e6009" name="xd21e6009src">31</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>Coloma&rsquo;s
intervention in the matter was protested by the audiencia in a letter
to the Council of the Indies, dated April 7, 1670, on the grounds that
the senior <i lang="es">oidor</i> was also the <i lang="es">asesor</i>
and possible successor of the governor, and for that reason he was
disqualified from taking the latter&rsquo;s <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6029src" href=
"#xd21e6029" name="xd21e6029src">32</a></p>
<p>The audiencia suspended the proposed action of Coloma, pending the
reply of the Council of the Indies. In addition to the protest of the
audiencia, the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, on May 20, 1670, sent a report
of the case to the court, which act was in fulfillment of his regular
duties as <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, as prescribed by the laws of the
Indies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6043src" href="#xd21e6043" name=
"xd21e6043src">33</a> The notes from Manila were effective in bringing
about the desired results. Upon receipt of the communications, the
Council of the Indies, on June 17, 1671, ordered the nullification of
all former <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i>, cancelled Coloma&rsquo;s
appointment to take the <i lang="es">residencia</i> in question, on the
grounds that he had been the governor&rsquo;s <i lang="es">asesor</i>,
and appointed Fernando de Montemayor, the <i lang="es">oidor</i> next
in rank, to conduct the <i lang="es">residencia</i> of the
governor.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6064src" href="#xd21e6064" name=
"xd21e6064src">34</a> Salcedo had already been dead three years, and
two more transpired before his <i lang="es">residencia</i> was
completed and the <i lang="es">autos</i> thereof reviewed by the
Council.</p>
<p>The laws provided ample opportunity for appeal in cases of <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>. The <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of November 17,
1526, ordered that appeals might be made to the Council of the Indies
from judges of <i lang="es">residencia</i> in cases involving
liabilities in excess of 600 pesos.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6086src"
href="#xd21e6086" name="xd21e6086src">35</a> Many appeals were made to
the Council in accord with this law, and the time of the tribunal was

small importance. To obviate this defect the law was changed on August
7, 1568, to provide that no case could be appealed to the Council of
the Indies unless the sentence imposed capital punishment or
deprivation of office.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6094src" href=
"#xd21e6094" name="xd21e6094src">36</a> The <i lang=

<p>Philip IV initiated further reforms in regard to appeal in 1636.

and <i lang="es">residencias</i> which are seen and determined in our
Council of the Indies,&rdquo; cases did not have to be referred to the
king for consultation, excepting when, in &ldquo;the <i lang=
"es">residencias</i> of viceroys, presidents, and <i lang=
"es">oidores</i>, <i lang="es">alcaldes del crimen</i>, and <i lang=

them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6151src" href="#xd21e6151"
name="xd21e6151src">40</a> In these cases the Council was ordered to
submit its decisions and all papers bearing thereon to the king before
passing judgment, so that the final judgment might be rendered by the
sovereign in person. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href=
"#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>Council could take final action in
the <i lang="es">residencias</i> of military and naval officials
without consulting the king. It was, of course, impossible for the
sovereign to give his personal attention to any of these matters, but
the last word was pronounced in these suits by responsible ministers of
the court who stood high in the royal estimation.</p>
<p>Officials were usually obliged to submit to <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> before leaving the colony, also before their
promotion to higher posts.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6167src" href=
"#xd21e6167" name="xd21e6167src">41</a> Owing, however, to the paucity
of ships plying to New Spain and to the length of time elapsing between
sailing dates, officials could give bonds and leave before the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> was completed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6175src"
href="#xd21e6175" name="xd21e6175src">42</a> This was permitted only to
men of good character, whose services had been uniformly satisfactory,
and who were destined to some other post wherein their services were
indispensable. The investigation was then conducted in the absence of
the official concerned.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6181src" href=
"#xd21e6181" name="xd21e6181src">43</a> It was decreed by the <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> of December 30, 1776, that an annual deduction
of one-fifth of the total salary of the governors and viceroys
respectively should be made, until sufficient money had been taken out
to cover the probable costs and liabilities of their <i lang=
"es">residencias</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6196src" href=
"#xd21e6196" name="xd21e6196src">44</a> This was a special assessment,

money deducted thereby was to be returned <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>if nothing
detrimental were proved in the <i lang="es">residencia</i>. The last
year&rsquo;s salaries of <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> and <i lang=
"es">corregidores</i> were withheld, pending investigations of their
official conduct and a rendering of accounts of collections made by
them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6222src" href="#xd21e6222" name=
"xd21e6222src">46</a> If an official were cleared of all guilt, the
money which had been withheld was returned and the costs of <i lang=

"noteref" id="xd21e6230src" href="#xd21e6230" name=
"xd21e6230src">47</a> In case the official were found guilty of
misconduct, he had to forfeit his deposits, back-salary, bonds, and
frequently to pay a large fine in addition. The amount of the penalty,
of course, depended on the extent of the guilt. It may be said that in
the Philippines the royal treasury suffered no serious embarrassment
through having to bear costs of <i lang="es">residencia</i>.</p>
<p>The judges of <i lang="es">residencia</i> who served as such in
addition to their regular duties, received an additional compensation
which varied according to the place where the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> was held, its distance from the capital, and other
circumstances.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6247src" href="#xd21e6247"
name="xd21e6247src">48</a> This was modified by a reform of the
nineteenth century which awarded extra pay only in the case the
official were fined. This, of course, was intended to afford the
examining judge a stimulating interest in the case. Still later the
system of giving extra pay for <i lang="es">residencias</i> was
abolished.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6255src" href="#xd21e6255" name=
"xd21e6255src">49</a></p>
<p>A detailed survey of the governor&rsquo;s <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> in the Philippines would illustrate the influence
of the audiencia in such investigations. Unfortunately the story would
be long and little space remains for such a purpose. During the first
two centuries of Spanish rule in the Islands the <i lang=
"es">residencias</i> of the governors were especially stringent, many
of these officials suffering deprivation of office, imprisonment, and
exile. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>families and dependents of some were reduced to
the last extreme of poverty, while the victims themselves spent years
in some distant province, unable to defend themselves from their
enemies. Many victims of the <i lang="es">residencia</i> were purposely
put aside in order that no appeal could be heard from them. One would
occasionally find relief at last in a tardy pardon or in a modification
of sentence, obtained through friends at home, when these could be
reached, but more often death would intervene before the exercise of
executive clemency or revision of sentence could be obtained.</p>
<p>The factors of petty spite, malice, and personal ambition entered to
an extensive degree in the rendering of testimony at a <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>. A governor, recently arrived in the colony, would
be full of zeal and ardor to inaugurate a successful administration,
and make a good record for himself. The first duty that presented
itself on his arrival was that of taking or supervising his
predecessor&rsquo;s <i lang="es">residencia</i>. Frequently, before
arriving at Manila, the new governor would be in full possession of a
complete record of the misdeeds of his predecessor, and the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> of the latter was as good as taken.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6288src" href="#xd21e6288" name=
"xd21e6288src">50</a> <i lang="es">Oidores</i>, merchants, <i lang=
"es">alcaldes</i>, treasury officials, and churchmen, compelled to
stand aside and see a governor take his choice out of the best things,
leaving for them only the husks, were not slow in bringing charges at
the official <i lang="es">residencia</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6301src" href="#xd21e6301" name="xd21e6301src">51</a> A
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>new governor, desirous of demonstrating his
intention of starting an honest and vigorous administration, hearing
nothing but evil of his predecessor, would naturally lend himself as an
instrument to the malcontents. A <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, after
spending six years in conflict with a governor, could be depended on to
bring strenuous prosecution against him. A magistrate with enmity in
his heart for the governor whose <i lang="es">residencia</i> he was to
take, was no fit person to conduct an impartial investigation.</p>
<p>While as a rule the <i lang="es">residencias</i> of governors were
severe, due largely to the presence of the audiencia, that of Dr.
Sande, the first governor to submit to this investigation, illustrates
the evils of the <i lang="es">residencia</i> as conducted before the
establishment of the audiencia. His successor, Governor Ronquillo de
Pe&ntilde;alosa, conducted Sande&rsquo;s <i lang="es">residencia</i>
and sentenced him to pay a heavy fine, but he appealed the case to the
Audiencia of Mexico, by which tribunal, in the meantime, he had been
commissioned <i lang="es">oidor</i>. We have noted in an earlier
chapter Ronquillo&rsquo;s comments on the abject state into which the
administration of justice had fallen when a man could be promoted to a
magistracy in a tribunal which had jurisdiction over his own case on
appeal.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6344src" href="#xd21e6344" name=
"xd21e6344src">52</a> However, after the establishment of the
audiencia, and until the close of the nineteenth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>century, the <i lang="es">residencia</i> went to
the other extreme, and was, as a rule, exceedingly rigorous.</p>
<p>We may briefly note a few of the most severe <i lang=
"es">residencias</i> in which the influence of the audiencia told
against the victim. In 1625, Ger&oacute;nimo de Silva, temporary
governor, was imprisoned by the audiencia because he failed to pursue
the Dutch after their defeat in 1617. The real difficulty lay in the
fact that Silva had incurred the enmity of the senior <i lang=
"es">oidor</i>, who ultimately conducted the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>, because Silva&rsquo;s arrival in the Islands
deprived that magistrate of the command of the military and naval
forces of the Islands. Again, Governor Corcuera, after nine years of
very successful rule, during which he distinguished himself in several
campaigns of conquest and incidentally aroused the hostility and
jealousy of the <i lang="es">oidores</i>, was arrested on charges made
by the audiencia on the arrival of Governor Diego Fajardo in 1644. An
<i lang="es">oidor</i>, who was the personal enemy of Corcuera, was
designated to conduct the <i lang="es">residencia</i>, the ex-governor
was fined 25,000 pesos and was imprisoned five years while the
magistrates of the audiencia delayed the transmission of the papers
which permitted a rehearing of the case. At last his defense was sent
to the Council, the fine was remitted, he was given salary for the
period of his exile, and the post of governor of the Canaries was
conferred upon him. Although the audiencia was responsible for the
injustice in this case, Fajardo, as president and governor, was held
answerable in his own <i lang="es">residencia</i> for his conduct
toward his predecessor.</p>
<p>Governor Sim&oacute;n de Anda y Salazar, one of the most successful
governors the Islands had ever known, was made to suffer from the
personal malice of the <i lang="es">oidores</i> when he gave his last
<i lang="es">residencia</i> in 1776.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6385src" href="#xd21e6385" name="xd21e6385src">53</a> Among the
offenses which were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139"
name="pb139">139</a>]</span>proved against him was that of exercising
prejudice in conducting the <i lang="es">residencia</i> of Oidor
Villacorta, conducted under his supervision. The <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> had been rigorous, due no doubt to personal enmity
between the <i lang="es">oidor</i> and the governor, extending over a
period of many years. He was also fined 4000 pesos as a price for his
excessive zeal in the prosecution of the <i lang="es">residencia</i> of
his predecessor, Governor Ra&oacute;n, who had friends in the audiencia
to defend his memory and champion his cause.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6417src" href="#xd21e6417" name="xd21e6417src">54</a> Anda was
also shown to have absolved certain officials of <i lang="es">real
hacienda</i> of financial responsibility, permitting them to leave the
Islands without the consent of the audiencia. These and other charges
proved against him were said to have caused his premature death in
1776.</p>
<p>Governor Jos&eacute; Basco y Vargas, another very efficient
governor,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6447src" href="#xd21e6447" name=
"xd21e6447src">55</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href=
"#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>but one who had been opposed
throughout his term of office by the audiencia, was heavily fined in
1787 by the <i lang="es">oidor</i> designated to conduct the
investigation. The decision of the judge of <i lang="es">residencia</i>
was reversed by the Council of the Indies, however, and Vargas&rsquo;
exceptional merits were recognized to the extent of his being appointed
to the governorship of Cartagena, with the rank of rear admiral. In
taking the <i lang="es">residencia</i> of Vargas, the audiencia had
disagreed so completely that the tribunal was obliged to resort to the
extreme measure of appointing a churchman as arbiter. Fray
Ger&oacute;nimo Caraballo, the curate of Quiapo, was designated for
that duty.</p>
<p>Aside from the above brief references to notable cases in which the
audiencia exercised jurisdiction over the <i lang="es">residencias</i>
of governors, allowing itself to be influenced by considerations other
than those of justice, it seems desirable to review in detail at least
one case of the <i lang="es">residencia</i> of a governor, to show more
particularly just what authority was exercised by the tribunal, and
just how that authority was exercised.</p>
<p>We may select for this purpose the <i lang="es">residencia</i> of
Governor Felix Beringuer de Marquina, which was the last to be
conducted under the old laws, and the last, accordingly, of the severe
<i lang="es">residencias</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6480src" href=
"#xd21e6480" name="xd21e6480src">56</a> As governor and superintendent
of <i lang="es">real hacienda</i> Marquina assumed such power as no
other governor had ever exercised. He was opposed at every turn by the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>audiencia and probably no other governor ever
had so many of his measures vetoed or opposed by the home government as
he. The <i lang="es">fiscal</i> and <i lang="es">oidores</i> brought
many charges against him; these finally culminated, before the
expiration of his term, in the royal order of February 19, 1792, for
the taking of his <i lang="es">residencia</i>. The regent,
Agust&iacute;n de Ampar&aacute;n, was put in possession of the special
charges which had been made against Marquina. According to these the
governor had been careless in defending the Islands against the Moros,
who had insulted and robbed with impunity the various settlements, with
no effort having been made to check their advance. The governor had
transgressed in numerous instances the sphere of the audiencia and had
substituted his own authority. He was said to have been guilty of
immoral relations with certain Spanish women of the colony, having
deliberately and maliciously separated an intendant from his wife on
one occasion by ordering the former to a post of duty where no woman
could go; he had amassed a great fortune through trade and by diverting
the proceeds of the royal revenue to his own private advantage; he had
permitted merchants to conduct business without proper licenses; he had
allowed foreign merchants to remain in Manila under conditions
forbidden by law.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6501src" href="#xd21e6501"
name="xd21e6501src">57</a> These and many others were the charges
brought against Governor Marquina. They may be considered as typical of
the accusations which were usually brought against governors in their
<i lang="es">residencias</i>.</p>
<p>Ampar&aacute;n was commanded by the royal order above-mentioned to
remove Marquina to some spot outside Manila where he could not
interfere with the <i lang="es">residencia</i>, but whence he could be
summoned at any time, to give testimony in his own behalf.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6513src" href="#xd21e6513" name=
"xd21e6513src">58</a> The regent was instructed to ascertain from the
treasury officials whether Marquina should not be required to post more
than the usual amount of bonds in view of the grave <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>charges against him. It seems that the law
already cited requiring an annual deduction of one-fifth of the
governor&rsquo;s salary to cover <i lang="es">residencia</i> had been
abrogated by a royal order dated February 13, 1782; hence there was
some apprehension lest Marquina had not deposited sufficient
money.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6521src" href="#xd21e6521" name=
"xd21e6521src">59</a></p>
<p>In compliance with these orders Marquina was relieved of his office
in September, 1792, and was sent to Laguna de Bay, about thirty miles
from Manila. After five months&rsquo; delay, the investigation was
inaugurated and it was concluded by July 22, 1793, but Aguilar, the new
governor, intervened and suspended the sentence on the ground that
Marquina had not been given sufficient opportunity to defend himself.
Up to this time Marquina had not testified directly. Aguilar ordered
that the ex-governor should be brought to Manila and that a lawyer
should be appointed for his defense. This was done and the charges
which had been made against him were duly answered. This evidence could
not be incorporated in the official papers of <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>, for they had been finished and closed by the
regent, but it was forwarded to Spain under separate cover.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6544src" href="#xd21e6544" name=
"xd21e6544src">60</a></p>
<p>The official papers of Marquina&rsquo;s <i lang="es">residencia</i>,
as formulated by the regent of the audiencia, arrived before the
Council of the Indies in due time, together with Marquina&rsquo;s
defense which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>had been sent separately. The glaring injustice
of the investigation as conducted by Ampar&aacute;n and of the official
evidence transmitted, was patent to the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> of the
Council. He refused to receive any testimony not incorporated in the
official papers of the case. Marquina was allowed a retrial by the
Council. This resulted in a further delay of three years; during this
period Marquina remained in the provinces with the exception of the
time spent in Manila giving testimony in his second <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>, which was taken under the direct supervision of
Governor Aguilar. Immediately after his second trial Marquina was
transferred to Mexico, but he was obliged to deposit an additional
50,000 pesos before his departure from Manila.</p>
<p>In the ultimate judgment Marquina was pronounced guilty of many
offenses in addition to those mentioned in the charges previously
outlined. He had shown favoritism in the dispensation of official
favors; he had authorized the expenditure of public money for private
ends; he had neglected defense and agriculture; he had been negligent
in the supervision of the various departments of <i lang="es">real
hacienda</i> and particularly of tobacco; he had infringed on the
jurisdiction of the royal audiencia. He had indulged in private trade
and had granted special favors to foreign merchants.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6571src" href="#xd21e6571" name="xd21e6571src">61</a></p>
<p>The regent fined him 40,000 pesos outright and, moreover, he was
condemned to pay into the royal treasury an additional fine of 16,000
pesos to cover certain illegitimate profits made through granting
unlawful trading concessions to an Armenian merchant. This sentence was
not executed immediately, as it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144"
href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>had to be confirmed by the
Council of the Indies. On review of the findings and recommendations of
the regent, the Council declared that since the proceedings at the
trial of Marquina had been irregular and the governor had already
suffered the consequences of his own misdeeds, the fine imposed by the
judge of the <i lang="es">residencia</i> in Manila might be reduced to
2000 pesos with costs of trial. Marquina on October 12, 1797, asked to
be excused from the payment of the 2000 pesos, but the Council denied
his petition, declaring that he had been treated with great
consideration and mercy and that nothing more could be done in his
behalf, especially since he had not been adjudged innocent of the
charges which had been made against him.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6587src" href="#xd21e6587" name="xd21e6587src">62</a></p>
<p>Marquina&rsquo;s trial illustrates all the characteristics, the
delays, terrors, and ramifications of a typical <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
Continued complaints against him caused Marquina&rsquo;s <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> to be taken before the expiration of his official
term. The regent of the audiencia was commissioned by the court to
conduct the investigation because Marquina&rsquo;s successor had not
arrived. That magistrate was prejudiced against Marquina on account of
having witnessed the governor&rsquo;s continual malfeasance in office.
He was unable to conduct an impartial investigation, and the audiencia,
likewise prejudiced, would not intervene in behalf of the ex-governor.
The wrongs done to Marquina in his trial <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>were so patent that
the Council of the Indies ordered a new hearing. A severe sentence was
finally passed by the judge in Manila, but it was modified by the
Council of the Indies through considerations of justice. The <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> occupied ten years, and during the greater part of
that time the ex-governor remained in exile&mdash;a victim of his own
misdeeds, the faulty <i lang="es">residencia</i> system, and the
hostility of the audiencia. The customary severity of the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> was only mitigated in this case by the presence of
an impartial governor, who, unlike most governors whose desire was to
harass their victims, sought to secure a fair trial for his
predecessor. To accomplish this he was obliged to work against, rather
than in co-operation with the audiencia.</p>
<p>The above method of conducting <i lang="es">residencias</i> of
governors, presidents, viceroys, and superintendents was modified, as
already mentioned, by the reform of August 24, 1799. The new law
provided that the court, instead of the new governor, should appoint
the examining judge. The latter was no longer empowered to pronounce
sentence of any sort. He was only to conduct the investigation in the
future, remitting the <i lang="es">autos</i> of the case to the Council
of the Indies for final determination and sentence.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6627src" href="#xd21e6627" name="xd21e6627src">63</a> Again,
on March 16, 1797, the royal order of December 30, 1777, was re-enacted
and the practice was revived of deducting annually one-fifth of the
salaries of officials whose incomes were 8000 pesos a year or
more.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6632src" href="#xd21e6632" name=
"xd21e6632src">64</a> This law was again promulgated on January 18,
1848. Its purpose was to secure the retention of a sufficient sum of
money to guarantee all losses incident to the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>. It apparently continued in force until July 7,
1860, when governors and captains-general were declared exempt from
these discounts.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6644src" href="#xd21e6644"
name="xd21e6644src">65</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href=
"#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span></p>
<p>We shall now examine more particularly the jurisdiction of the
audiencia over the <i lang="es">residencias</i> of minor officials of
the colony. It has already been pointed out that the <i lang=
"es">residencias</i> of provincial judges and governors, <i lang=
"es">alcaldes ordinarios</i> and <i lang="es">reales oficiales</i> were
taken by judges appointed by the president of the audiencia, with
appeal to the tribunal. These cases, under certain circumstances, might
be taken on second appeal to the Council of the Indies. The practice in
these investigations may be best understood by noting the development
of the law regarding them, for, as we have already noted, the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> was the product of years of administrative
experience, during which various methods were tried, and rejected or
adopted as they were found respectively inadvisable or efficacious.</p>
<p>The earliest <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> on the subject, that of
November 17, 1526, ordered that the audiencia should try all appeals
from judges of <i lang="es">residencia</i>, wherein the amount involved
did not exceed 600 pesos. A law of Philip II, dated 1563, forbade
viceroys, presidents, and audiencias from sending judges of <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> or other investigators against judges of provinces,
unless complaint had been lodged against those officials by a person
willing to post bonds and pay the costs in case the charges proved to
be false.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6681src" href="#xd21e6681" name=
"xd21e6681src">66</a></p>
<p>The <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of September 3, 1565, laid down
the principle that the <i lang="es">residencias</i> of officers
appointed by viceroys and presidents <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>should be taken by
commission of those who appointed them.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6696src" href="#xd21e6696" name="xd21e6696src">67</a> As
regularly appointed <i lang="es">corregidores</i> and <i lang=
"es">alcaldes mayores</i> held royal commissions,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6708src" href="#xd21e6708" name="xd21e6708src">68</a> they did
not, according to this law, give <i lang="es">residencia</i> to judges
appointed by the governor. The Council of the Indies, therefore, should
name judges to investigate the official conduct of its own appointees.
As a matter of fact, however, the Council delegated this authority to
the governor and audiencia. This latter practice was authorized by a
clause in the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of September 3, 1565,
which provided that <i lang="es">residencias</i> of the officials
referred to should be taken under supervision of the audiencias in the
districts wherein the officials resided. This meant that while the
audiencia was not to interfere in the taking of the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> itself, the tribunal was to see that the laws
regarding <i lang="es">residencias</i> were faithfully executed. The
law of March 11, 1591, ordered that if the conduct of <i lang=
"es">corregidores</i>, <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i>, and other
magistrates demanded that their <i lang="es">residencias</i> should be
taken before the completion of their term of office, the viceroys,
presidents, or governors should appoint judges for the
purpose.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6738src" href="#xd21e6738" name=
"xd21e6738src">69</a> Nothing was said in this <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> relative to the authority of the audiencia in
this matter, but the law of January 19, 1608, gave to the audiencia the
right to try <i lang="es">residencia</i> cases on appeal from the
sentences of these special judges.</p>
<p>The laws of June 3 and June 19, 1620, provided that the governor and
audiencia should decide in <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> whether the
<i lang="es">residencia</i> of a <i lang="es">gobernador</i>, <i lang=
"es">corregidor</i>, or an <i lang="es">alcalde mayor</i> should be
taken. Neither the governor nor the audiencia was to have complete
authority in the matter, but each should participate, the audiencia
assisting in the decision as to whether the case merited investigation
and the governor making out the commission and appointing the judge if
an investigation were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href=
"#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>necessary. The audiencia, alone,
was authorized to appoint judges of <i lang="es">residencia</i> for
judicial officers only.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6773src" href=
"#xd21e6773" name="xd21e6773src">70</a> The interference of the
audiencia in the <i lang="es">residencias</i> of governors, <i lang=
"es">corregidores</i>, <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i>, and other
justices and ministers provided by royal appointment was definitely
forbidden by the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of April 20, 1639, as
this jurisdiction was declared to belong to the Council of the
Indies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6791src" href="#xd21e6791" name=
"xd21e6791src">71</a> Although we have evidence that the Council did
exercise such jurisdiction, it was always on review of cases appealed
from the audiencias. While the above prohibition forbade the audiencia
from taking the <i lang="es">residencias</i> of these officials it did
not restrain the tribunal from participating in the decision as to
whether a <i lang="es">residencia</i> should be taken, or in the review
of the <i lang="es">autos</i> of <i lang="es">residencia</i>.</p>
<p>An illustration of the intervention of the Council of the Indies in
<i lang="es">residencias</i> of <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> is
shown in the case of Josef Tormento, <i lang="es">alcalde</i> of
Caragara. On June 6, 1786, he was sentenced in <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> to a pecuniary penalty, perpetual deprivation of
office, and two years&rsquo; exile from Manila. This sentence was
confirmed in review by the audiencia on October 8 of the same year. The
Council modified this sentence, however, approving the fine, but
cancelling the other provisions.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6823src"
href="#xd21e6823" name="xd21e6823src">72</a> In 1803 the incumbent of
the same post, Antonio Mateo, was incarcerated by order of the
audiencia, pending investigation of the charge made against him that he
had used the funds of his office for private trade. It was shown,
however, that this official knew the location of a quicksilver deposit
of great value, whereupon the governor had him removed from prison,
ordering the suspension of the charges against him, notwithstanding the
protests of the <i lang="es">oidores</i>. The <i lang="es">fiscal</i>
concurred in the action of the governor. The audiencia appealed the
case to the Council of the Indies, alleging conspiracy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>between the governor and the <i lang=
"es">fiscal</i>. The Council, however, on examination of the case,
approved their action, ordered the charges to be dismissed, and gave
directions that the <i lang="es">alcalde mayor</i> should be restored
to his former position or given another of equal category as soon as
possible.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6841src" href="#xd21e6841" name=
"xd21e6841src">73</a></p>
<p>Although the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of August 24, 1799, gave
the audiencia the right to conduct the <i lang="es">residencias</i> of
<i lang="es">corregidores</i> and <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i>,
this case involved certain interesting features which should be pointed
out in this connection. In the first place, it shows the manner in
which the Council of the Indies exercised ultimate authority in matters
of <i lang="es">residencia</i>. Again, it reveals the influence which
the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> and even the governor might have in
determining whether suit should be brought,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6865src" href="#xd21e6865" name="xd21e6865src">74</a> and finally
it indicates that expediency might constitute an important factor in
the ultimate results of a case of this kind.</p>
<p>The practice of granting jurisdiction over the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> of an official to the authority that appointed him
seems to have been followed repeatedly. This principle was enunciated
in the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of August 20, 1758, but on August
8, 1764, a royal decree authorized viceroys and presidents to name
judges of <i lang="es">residencia</i> for all officials holding royal
appointments, with the condition that the <i lang="es">autos</i> should
be forwarded to the Council of the Indies. This law was repealed on
April 23, 1769.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6884src" href="#xd21e6884"
name="xd21e6884src">75</a></p>
<p>The <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of August 24, 1799, which has
been mentioned several times in this chapter, was a reform of the
greatest importance in the history of the <i lang="es">residencia</i>.
Prior to its promulgation, all officials had to give <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>, but this law abolished that universal requirement.
It provided that <i lang="es">residencias</i> of <i lang=
"es">corregidores</i>, <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i>, and
subdelegate-intendants should be taken only when charges had been made
against them. This might occur at any time during their term
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>of office, or at the close of their service.
These investigations had to be concluded within four months, but if
charges were not made against an official his past record was not
investigated.</p>
<p>The length of time consumed in all <i lang="es">residencias</i>
except those of viceroys was limited to four months. The period
allotted for these investigations was divided into two parts.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6917src" href="#xd21e6917" name=
"xd21e6917src">76</a> During the first half, edicts or notices of
<i lang="es">residencia</i> were posted throughout the district of the
official concerned. These were printed in Spanish and in the common
dialect, so that natives and others concerned might read and know that
the official was giving up his post and that charges might be brought
against him, setting forth any misconduct, undue harshness, tyranny or
dishonesty of which he had been guilty during his term of office. These
notices invited them to register any complaints which they might wish
to make and gave them sixty days in which to do it. At the close of
this period the judge of <i lang="es">residencia</i> opened an
investigation in the town wherein the official under examination had
resided, usually the capital of the province. The actual trial of
<i lang="es">residencia</i> might consume sixty days, or it might be
perfunctory in its character and occupy a much shorter period, the
entire question of time depending on the amount of evidence presented
against the retiring official. On the other hand, as we have seen, the
<i lang="es">residencia</i> of a governor might occupy ten years.</p>
<p>If the judge were taking a <i lang="es">residencia</i> in the
provinces he was frequently delayed in arriving at his post of duty,
owing to the pressure of other business, or to the uncertainty of
transportation facilities. In that event, he could not open the
judicial investigation until the allotted period had almost
transpired.</p>
<p>In the trial, two distinct lines of investigation were usually
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>pursued: charges which had been made against the
official were investigated and the records of his office were examined.
The discovery was frequently made through this procedure that the
official had embezzled money belonging to the government, usually
investing it in private ventures. The inquiry might show that he had
been careless in the execution of the duties of his office, remiss in
his attention to <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>, particularly neglecting
the Indians thereon, or too ignorant and incompetent to try properly,
record, and transmit the <i lang="es">autos</i> of the cases which had
come to him in first instance. These defects might not become apparent
until they were revealed in this examination.</p>
<p>The judge of <i lang="es">residencia</i> would seem to have been
well occupied during the time that he was conducting the investigation.
He received and reviewed all charges made. In addition to auditing the
records of the office, he had to pursue inquiries as to the truth of
these charges. He examined witnesses both for and against the
defendant, and was supposed to give the official under investigation
every opportunity to defend himself. He was relieved, however, of the
trouble and responsibility of checking up the financial accounts of the
official under <i lang="es">residencia</i>. This important matter was
turned over to the treasury officials, who ascertained shortages, and
held the bondsmen of the official under investigation
responsible.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6958src" href="#xd21e6958"
name="xd21e6958src">77</a> The judges of <i lang="es">residencia</i>,
and the <i lang="es">oidores</i> making investigations and reviewing
cases of <i lang="es">residencia</i> were ordered to confine their
examinations to &ldquo;criminal and legal matters and charges which
result against those under <i lang="es">residencia</i>.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6979src" href="#xd21e6979" name=
"xd21e6979src">78</a></p>
<p>After all the evidence had been taken and the case had been duly
tried, the judge of <i lang="es">residencia</i> was authorized to
render sentence. Sentences were executed by the examining judge if
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>the penalty did not exceed twenty-five thousand
<i lang="es">maraved&iacute;s</i>. The latter cases were not
appealable. If the fine were less than two hundred ducats and the
defendant desired to appeal, he was obliged to pay the fine or deposit
the amount thereof. His case would then be reviewed by the audiencia
and in order to effect this, notice of appeal had to be submitted in
sufficient time to permit the record of the entire case to be reduced
to writing. If, on review, the audiencia found that the defendant was
not guilty of the charges which had been brought against him, the money
taken as a fine or deposit was restored. If the amount of the fine
exceeded two hundred ducats, or if the defendant had been convicted of
serious crimes, the judge was authorized to take the proper and
necessary steps for the detention of the prisoner and the seizure of
his property pending a new trial in the higher tribunal.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6994src" href="#xd21e6994" name=
"xd21e6994src">79</a> Cases involving more than one thousand pesos
could be carried to the Council of the Indies.</p>
<p>A thoroughly typical case, illustrating all of the ramifications of
a provincial official&rsquo;s <i lang="es">residencia</i>, was that of
Francisco Fern&aacute;ndez Z&eacute;ndera, <i lang="es">alcalde
mayor</i> and military captain of the province of Ilocos.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7007src" href="#xd21e7007" name=
"xd21e7007src">80</a> It was investigated first by a judge appointed by
the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i>, it was reviewed by the audiencia and it
was finally carried to the Council of the Indies. It was characteristic
in another sense, namely, in that twelve years passed before the matter
was settled.</p>
<p>After Z&eacute;ndera had occupied his post three years, complaints
against him were brought to the attention of the <i lang=
"es">fiscal</i>. In his capacity as prosecuting official and as
protector of the Indians, he made a motion before the audiencia in
<i lang="es">acuerdo</i>, that a judge of <i lang="es">residencia</i>
should be sent to conduct an investigation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>of
Z&eacute;ndera&rsquo;s official conduct. The following charges against
Z&eacute;ndera had been sent to the governor, and on the basis of
these, the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, governor, and audiencia decided to
conduct the investigation: First, Z&eacute;ndera had compelled natives
to work for him on his own estates, building houses, granaries, fences,
tilling the soil and planting crops, from two hundred to three hundred
men having worked for him continually, without pay or food; second, the
arbitrary methods of this <i lang="es">alcalde mayor</i> left the
natives without money with which to buy their food or to pay their
tribute; third, not only were the men forced to labor, but the women
were obliged to sew, spin and embroider without pay, and the product of
their labor was confiscated by the <i lang="es">alcalde mayor</i>.</p>
<p>The audiencia and the governor, in <i lang="es">acuerdo</i>, having
taken note of these charges, commissioned Angel Moguel, chief secretary
of the government, to conduct the <i lang="es">residencia</i> of the
<i lang="es">alcalde</i>. Moguel was put in possession of the necessary
documents and departed at once for Vig&aacute;n, the head city of the
province. On November 7, 1782, he posted notices to the effect that
Z&eacute;ndera&rsquo;s <i lang="es">residencia</i> was to be taken,
calling on the residents to make formal charges against him. Moguel
suspended Z&eacute;ndera from office and accepted 20,000 pesos from two
of his friends as bonds to cover the <i lang="es">residencia</i>, this
sum offsetting the valuation of the properties for which Z&eacute;ndera
was responsible. These were additional to other bonds which
Z&eacute;ndera had posted on his accession to office.</p>
<p>For some unassigned reason, only twenty-five days were allowed for
the filing of complaints, but during this time eighty-eight charges
were made, most of which were variations of those mentioned above.
Z&eacute;ndera was said to have been uncompromising in his
administration of justice; he had imposed excessive fines; he had
imprisoned the natives without giving them opportunities for defense;
he had refused to allow them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href=
"#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>to appeal their cases.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7060src" href="#xd21e7060" name=
"xd21e7060src">81</a> Not being a lawyer, he lacked sufficient
qualifications for the proper conduct of trials; moreover he had
refused to employ a <i lang="es">teniente</i> or <i lang=
"es">asesor</i>. He had failed to supervise and enforce the instruction
of Spanish, and he had done nothing to assist in the education of the
natives. Z&eacute;ndera was charged with having suppressed all commerce
except his own, going so far as to arrest merchants of other provinces
who came to Ilocos to trade. This he had done to secure his own
monopoly in commercial matters. He had, moreover, suppressed the trade
of the Ilocanos with the Igorrotes. He had failed to segregate the men
from the women in the provincial prison. It was said that he had
neglected to publish the governor&rsquo;s edicts (<i lang=
"es">bandos</i>) from Manila. He had shown partiality to Spanish
priests in preference to the native clergy. He was charged with having
taken rice as tribute at a low price, turning it over to the treasury
officials at a higher rate, thereby making great profits for
himself.</p>
<p>Z&eacute;ndera was found guilty of almost every charge made against
him. The sentence of <i lang="es">residencia</i> was pronounced by the
judge commissioned for the purpose on August 13, 1782. The defendant
was fined 8000 pesos and sentenced to deprivation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>of
office for a period of eight years.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7104src"
href="#xd21e7104" name="xd21e7104src">82</a> The audiencia, in turn,
reviewed the case, and that tribunal, on May 20, 1783, finding the
<i lang="es">autos</i> of the case incomplete, ordered Moguel back to
Vig&aacute;n for a second time to complete the investigation. The
judgment of <i lang="es">residencia</i> after this second investigation
was made was the same as before, and the case was carried to the
Council of the Indies on November 7, 1785. It seems that in this case
the audiencia was somewhat slow in granting the appeal, for on February
19, 1788, a <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> was expedited which ordered
the audiencia to forward all the <i lang="es">autos</i> in its
possession bearing on the case. The final judgment of the Council of
the Indies was rendered March 23, 1794. The fine of 8000 pesos was
reduced to 3000 pesos, and the portion of the sentence which had
ordered a deprivation of office was remitted altogether.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7139src" href="#xd21e7139" name=
"xd21e7139src">83</a></p>
<p>The <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of August 24, 1799, already
referred to, greatly altered the applicability of the <i lang=
"es">residencias</i> to provincial as well as insular officials. Its
greatest importance was due to the fact that it authorized
investigations of <i lang="es">corregidores</i>, <i lang="es">alcaldes
mayores</i>, and sub-delegate intendants only when charges were made
against them; otherwise it was assumed that their official conduct had
been satisfactory, and accordingly no <i lang="es">residencias</i> were
held. Before the officials could be transferred to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>other posts they were obliged to show
certificates of clearance from former positions. The audiencia was
given final jurisdiction over the <i lang="es">residencias</i> of these
officials, with inhibition of appeal. At the same time the tribunal was
denied jurisdiction in any instance over the <i lang=
"es">residencias</i> of viceroys, captains-general, presidents,
governors, treasury officials, <i lang="es">oidores</i>, and
intendants.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7177src" href="#xd21e7177" name=
"xd21e7177src">84</a> After the suppression of the Council of the
Indies on March 24, 1834, the latter cases were finished in the Supreme
Tribunal of Justice, and that tribunal continued to exercise this
jurisdiction till the close of the nineteenth century.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7188src" href="#xd21e7188" name=
"xd21e7188src">85</a></p>
<p>The <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> above referred to abolished the
<i lang="es">residencias</i> of <i lang="es">tenientes letrados</i>,
<i lang="es">alcaldes ordinarios</i>, <i lang="es">regidores</i>,
clerks, procurators, syndics, <i lang="es">alguaciles</i>, and other
minor officials. In place of the formal investigation and judgment
after the term of office was completed, the audiencia was given more
complete control over their official acts, with the duty of seeing that
justice was administered, jails inspected and kept clean, prisoners
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>given a speedy trial and not molested with undue
exactions, and the police supervised. The tribunal was also empowered
to see that the <i lang="es">ayuntamientos</i> conducted their
elections impartially and that the municipal officials executed their
duties faithfully. In this way the formal investigation at the close of
the term of these minor officials was replaced by a more efficient
supervision of their acts by the audiencia. The constitutional reforms
of the early nineteenth century gave to the audiencia original
jurisdiction over the trial of judges of first instance, with appeal to
the Supreme Tribunal of Justice. This authority was suppressed in 1815,
and continued so until 1835, when it was restored to the audiencias of
the colonies.</p>
<p>Although the reform of August 24, 1799, recognized the <i lang=
"es">residencias</i> of <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i>, <i lang=
"es">tenientes</i>, and <i lang="es">corregidores</i>, merely
transferring jurisdiction over these to the audiencias, it would seem
that this investigation retained less of its former severity from this
time onwards. In fact, some authorities infer that the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> was abolished after 1799.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7276src" href="#xd21e7276" name="xd21e7276src">86</a> This was
not the case, however, as the <i lang="es">residencia</i> was
recognized by laws promulgated as lately as 1870.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7310src" href="#xd21e7310" name="xd21e7310src">87</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span></p>
<p>The audiencia also had jurisdiction over the <i lang=
"es">residencias</i> of galleon officials. These had to submit to
<i lang="es">residencia</i> at the termination of each voyage. An
<i lang="es">oidor</i> was designated by the governor for the
inspection of the ship, for the examination of its papers, for the
consideration of complaints against the officers of ill-treatment of
passengers and crews during the voyage.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7351src" href="#xd21e7351" name="xd21e7351src">88</a> An
investigation was conducted on the occasion of the loss of a ship. Then
a thorough inquiry was made in an endeavor to discover negligence on
the part of the admiral, general, or other officials. The exercise of a
similar authority over cases involving the loss of galleons has been
discussed in the preceding chapter.</p>
<p>In pursuance of this authority, Magistrate Torralba was commissioned
in 1710 to take the <i lang="es">residencia</i> of the officers of the
galleon &ldquo;Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario y San Vicente
Ferrer&rdquo;, which was wrecked in the Straits of San Bernardino on
the voyage from Acapulco in 1709.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7361src"
href="#xd21e7361" name="xd21e7361src">89</a> As great diligence had
been shown by them in landing the treasure and sending it overland, the
matter was dropped. A similar investigation was conducted in 1743 in
the case of the galleon &ldquo;Cobadonga&rdquo;, which was captured by
the British. The charge was made that neither the
&ldquo;Cobadonga&rdquo; nor her convoy, &ldquo;El Pilar&rdquo;, had
offered any resistance, and that the latter had deserted the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>galleon and had taken refuge in flight.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7366src" href="#xd21e7366" name=
"xd21e7366src">90</a> The officers were arrested and thrown into prison
on charges brought by the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, but they were
cleared in the investigation which proved that the ships were not in a
condition to fight.</p>
<p>The various laws and cases which have been cited in this chapter
show that the trial of <i lang="es">residencia</i> of captains-general,
treasury officials, <i lang="es">oidores</i>, intendants, <i lang=
"es">alcaldes mayores</i>, and <i lang="es">alcaldes ordinarios</i> was
a judicial function over which the audiencia had a large share of
authority. It is safe to say that no <i lang="es">residencia</i> was
ever taken in the Philippines, after the audiencia had been established
there, in which that tribunal did not exercise some degree of
authority. As the laws and regulations of the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> varied at different times, the extent of the
jurisdiction of the audiencia in this matter was not always the same.
The audiencia either assisted in the examination of the charges or in
the designation of the judge. The magistrate selected was usually an
<i lang="es">oidor</i>. <i lang="es">Oidores</i> were liable to
designation to conduct inquiries, and the audiencia, as a tribunal,
tried these cases in review. The tribunal exercised supervision over
the work of the investigating judge. The case was either finished in
the audiencia, or reviewed there and appealed to the Council of the
Indies through the action of the audiencia. The Council of the Indies
was the supreme arbiter in all cases, prior to 1799. Subsequently the
Council, or the Supreme Tribunal of Justice after 1834, retained final
jurisdiction over the <i lang="es">residencias</i> of the higher
officials only. In the <i lang="es">residencias</i> of provincial or
local officials the jurisdiction of the audiencia was final.

Bancroft, <i>History of Central America</i>, I, 250&ndash;1. Special
emphasis should be placed upon the last clause of the above definition.
The periodical <i lang="es">residencia</i> was not the sole means for
the removal of officials in the Spanish colonies. The conclusion seems
to have been reached by many historians that officials were permitted
to conduct themselves carelessly, running their offices to suit their
own personal convenience from the date of their appointment, in the
assurance that their tenure was sure until the termination of a
specified term, and that the periodical <i lang="es">residencia</i> was
the only occasion on which they might be held to answer for their sins.
Only the most scant attention has been given by modern writers to the
<i lang="es">residencia</i>. See Bourne, &ldquo;Historical

Sinibaldo de Mas, the able Philippine critic of the nineteenth century,
says in regard to the above characteristic of the <i lang=
"es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i> and its laws: &ldquo;Since the <i lang=
"es">Leyes de Indias</i> are not a constitutional code, but a
compilation made in the year 1754 [a footnote amends this statement
with the information that the <i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i> was
first made in 1681] of royal orders despatched at various epochs and by
distinct monarchs, ... there results ... a confusion of
jurisdictions.&rdquo;&mdash;Mas, Internal political condition of the
Philippines, Blair and Robertson, LII, 70.</p>
<p class="footnote">Dr. James Alexander Robertson, in his article on
&ldquo;Legaspi and Philippine colonization&rdquo; (see American
Historical Association, <i>Annual report, 1907</i>, I, 150 and note),
characterizes the laws of the Indies as &ldquo;that mass of
contradictory legislation,&rdquo; largely &ldquo;ecclesiastical in
tone,&rdquo; ill-digested, and &ldquo;utterly at variance with one
another.&rdquo; Dr. Robertson also states that &ldquo;it is from a too
close following of these laws and a too great neglect of actual
conditions that writers on the colonial policy of Spain have at times
fallen into error.&rdquo; On the other hand, it may be said, that not
enough use has been made by modern writers of the laws of the Indies,
and there is need of such investigation as will test that oft-repeated
statement that the laws of the Indies were not enforced. Up to the
present, Latin American scholarship has been content with a rehashing
of Helps and Prescott, for the early periods, omitting the seventeenth
century and the greater part of the eighteenth altogether, and fixing
on Juan y Ulloa, Robertson, and Humboldt as the great all-determining
authorities for the latter periods of Spanish colonization. These,
indeed, have been supplemented by a few ecclesiastical histories, each
of which has been written to prove a particular thesis. The present
writer dares to believe, after some attempt to harmonize the laws of
the Indies with actual practice, that these laws were actually used as
a basis of colonial government, and that, while not always effectively
enforced, they were by no means a dead-letter until Spain actually lost
her colonies and are not today, for it is easy to see in the laws of
the Indies the fundamentals of the institutions of present-day Spanish
America.</p>

Officials, desirous of ingratiating themselves into the favor of the
new executive, frequently journeyed by land and sea from Manila as far
as the Straits of San Bernardino. The privilege thus gained of
returning to Manila in company with the new governor, gave them the
unrestricted or unqualified opportunity to poison his mind with tales
of the misdeeds of the incumbent, and insinuations as to the wealth
which the latter had heaped up for himself through the exercise of
dishonest methods.</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6301" href="#xd21e6301src" name="xd21e6301">51</a></span> The
<i lang="es">residencia</i> of a governor presented a splendid
opportunity to his enemies for revenge. A governor was always in a fair
way to make enemies; consequently any such awaited the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> of their former oppressor with great eagerness. In
case a governor did make fair profit out of his office, and there were
many opportunities for profit, commercial and otherwise, legitimate and
illegitimate, his enemies gave him no rest at the time of his <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>. (According to Mart&iacute;nez de
Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga [<i lang="es">Estadismo</i>. I, 242] the
emoluments of the governor, aside from his salary, aggregated 20,000
pesos a year.) It is probable that most of the governors were
dishonest, as the opportunities for corruption were numerous, and the
temptations offered by the position were too powerful to be resisted by
any human being. Thousands of miles from Spain, in an age of slow
communication, entrusted with the assignment of all sorts of lucrative
offices, <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>, and commercial privileges, and
having friends, relatives, and special interests to serve, a governor
was surrounded by countless officials who were eagerly awaiting their
share of booty, and who were ready at a moment&rsquo;s notice to turn
traitor if they could gain by such an act. It may be said of the
Spanish colonial governor as was said of Verres of old, that in
stealing, one must steal threefold, once for himself, once for his
judges, and once to pay the penalty.</p>

y Vidal, <i lang="es">Historia general</i>, II, 253&ndash;258. Anda, as
it will be noted later, spent an earlier term of service in the
Philippines. He first came to the Philippines during the administration
of Governor Arand&iacute;a, as <i lang="es">oidor</i> of the audiencia.
He had therefore been obliged to submit to <i lang="es">residencia</i>
on a previous occasion; in 1764 a review was made of his official
conduct as <i lang="es">oidor</i>, and especially of his acts in
defiance of Archbishop Rojo, in setting up claims to the governorship
of the Islands and resisting the British. His conduct was approved, and
he received high honor and promotion at the court, being advanced to
membership in the Council of Castile. On November 19, 1769, he was
granted an annual pension of 3000 pesos for life. On September 8, 1777,
this pension was continued in favor of his eldest son (A. I.,
106&ndash;4&ndash;4).</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6417" href="#xd21e6417src" name="xd21e6417">54</a></span> Anda
had more than the usual number of <i lang="es">residencias</i> to
supervise at the beginning of his term. Owing to some misapprehension
on the part of his predecessor, Governor Ra&oacute;n, no <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> was required of La Torre, the <i lang="es">teniente
del rey</i> who took over the government in 1764. Owing to the
anarchical condition in Manila consequent upon the invasion of the
British, and the ecclesiastical rule preceding that event, neither
Arand&iacute;a, Espeleta, nor Rojo had given <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>. The audiencia and Ra&oacute;n in <i lang=
"es">acuerdo</i> on October 26, 1768, voted that governors&rsquo;
<i lang="es">residencias</i> should be dispensed with, and apparently
believed that this action settled the matter. On November 9, 1770, the
Council of the Indies disapproved of this stand, fined Ra&oacute;n (who
had died the preceding July), and ordered Anda to take the <i lang=
"es">residencias</i> of Arand&iacute;a (governor, 1754&ndash;1759),
Espeleta (archbishop-governor, 1759&ndash;1761), Rojo
(archbishop-governor, 1761&ndash;1764), Oidor Villacorta, and Governor
Ra&oacute;n. These orders he complied with, conducting the
investigations with his characteristic thoroughness, though Rojo and
Ra&oacute;n were dead. Villacorta was imprisoned and heavily fined. The
sentences against Arand&iacute;a, Ra&oacute;n and Villacorta were
moderated by the Council of the Indies on September 9, 1772.&mdash;A.

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

<i lang="es">residencia</i> was held under the same laws that had
prevailed throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. A
feature common to them all, particularly, was the fact that the regent,
or some other colonial magistrate conducted the investigation and gave
sentence, which might be appealed to the Council of the Indies. This
gave an opportunity for great injustice to be done to the governor by
his enemies, and it did not give him an impartial hearing. The laws of
1799 still permitted a local magistrate to collect the evidence, but
the decision was rendered by the Council of the Indies.</p>

Instructions were also given at the same time for investigations of the
official conduct of numerous persons who had been identified with the
government of Marquina. Among these were Helari&oacute;n Pastor,
<i lang="es">fiscal de la real hacienda</i>. Manuel de Sota, <i lang=

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

just and honorable conduct of Marquina&rsquo;s successor on this
occasion may be contrasted with that of his various predecessors, whose
unfairness, bigotry, and stupidity had caused governors Corcuera,
Silva, and Torralba, victims of <i lang="es">residencia</i>, to be
seized, imprisoned, and exiled without opportunities for defense, while
their investigations were being conducted. This case serves well to
illustrate the fact that by the close of the eighteenth century the

charged with having entered into a conspiracy with an Armenian merchant
to secure trade which should have gone to Spanish merchants. In this
particular venture he had made a profit of 16,000 pesos and in so doing
he had not only violated the laws of the Indies which forbade officials
to trade (<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>, 2&ndash;16&ndash;54,
62), but he had connived at the infraction of another law which forbade
trade to foreigners (<i>ibid.</i>, 9&ndash;27&ndash;1, 5, 7 and note
2).</p>

an interesting commentary on Spanish methods that, notwithstanding
Marquina&rsquo;s misgovernment in the Philippines, he was promoted to
the post of viceroy of New Spain, which position he held from 1800 to
1803.</p>

of New Spain, engaging in the smuggling trade with Jamaica, and
enriching himself to the extent that in thirty-two months he was able
to send twelve million pesos on his own account to Spain. Desdevises du
Dezert inadvertently refers to Marquina as having come from the
Marianas to Mexico. He came from the Philippines and not from the
Marianas.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

said that he had shown favoritism in his dealings with some of the
<i lang="es">barangay</i> (district) chiefs, allowing them unbridled
license in the collection of tribute and in the enforcement of
compulsory labor, most of which they utilized for their own, or for
his, benefit. One chief was said to have gone so far as to forcibly
take carabaos from the natives when the latter were working them in the
fields. Z&eacute;ndera had, of course, extended favors to these
<i lang="es">barangay</i> chiefs in exchange for reciprocal advantages.
(The <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> ruled the native population
through these chiefs at this time. Later they utilized the <i lang=
"es">gobernadorcillos</i>, who were native or <i lang="es">mestizo</i>
governors of the small towns.&mdash;See Malcolm, <i>The government of
the Philippine Islands</i>, 64&ndash;72.)</p>
<p class="footnote">It was also charged that he had allowed cock-fights
whenever requested, instead of restricting these to holidays and
Sundays as the law prescribed. On these occasions he collected two
<i lang="es">reales</i> from each entrant, and in addition he took the
slain birds, alleging that they were for the consumption of the inmates
of the provincial prison. Testimony was produced to show that the
prisoners had never eaten fowl.</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

taking the <i lang="es">residencias</i> of <i lang=

audiencia frequently took great responsibility upon itself. On July 10,
1800, on taking the <i lang="es">residencia</i> of Lu&iacute;s
Rodr&iacute;guez Varela, <i lang="es">alcalde mayor</i> of
Pangasin&aacute;n, the audiencia suspended the decoration of the
<i lang="es">peque&ntilde;a cruz</i>, which had been conferred upon
this official by the royal authority. The deprivation, in this case,
was tentative, pending the investigation of the charges which had been
made of shortages in the finances of his province.&mdash;Audiencia to
the King, July 10, 1800, A. I., 106&ndash;4&ndash;18.</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

original sentence probably denied to Z&eacute;ndera the privilege of
holding the office of <i lang="es">alcalde mayor</i> only, since he
occupied the post of <i lang="es">regidor</i> of the city of Manila,
pending the appeal of his case to the Council of the Indies. It is
evident, therefore, that the sentence which was pronounced upon
Z&eacute;ndera did not apply to all positions of honor and trust.</p>

When the Intendancy was established in 1784&ndash;7, an effort was made
by the newly created officials to escape the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>. The entire term of the first intendant, Carvajal
(or Carbajal), had been devoted to an assertion of his independence of
the governor and audiencia. Carvajal interpreted the law requiring all
officials of the government to give <i lang="es">residencia</i> every
five years to the Department of Justice as not applying to him or his
subordinates. He pointed to the stipulation in the ordinance which
created his department, and established its independence of the
executive and judiciary. The king disapproved of his attitude and
ordered that henceforth the officials of <i lang="es">real hacienda</i>
should give <i lang="es">residencia</i> in the same manner as other
officials, in accordance with the laws of the Indies. (King to
Carvajal. July 29, 1788, A. I., 107&ndash;5&ndash;19, citing <i lang=
"es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>, 2&ndash;15&ndash;69; 5&ndash;15&ndash;15
and <i lang="es">Ordenanza de Intendentes de Buenos Ayres</i>, Art.
305.) This decree ordered that the <i lang="es">residencias</i> of the
intendants and their assistants should be submitted to the audiencia.
The <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of August 24, 1799, so frequently
cited in this chapter, gave final jurisdiction to the audiencia over
the <i lang="es">residencias</i> of <i lang=
"es">intendentes-corregidores</i>, but it decreed that superintendents
should give <i lang="es">residencia</i> directly to the Council of the
Indies.</p>

Escriche (<i lang="es">Diccionario</i>, II, 819) state that the
<i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of August 24, 1799, abolished the
<i lang="es">residencia</i>. The latter states that the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> was eliminated because of the corruption of judges,
and as the judges of <i lang="es">residencia</i> had proved to be a
grave infliction on the towns, mistreating witnesses and defendants on
many occasions, it was thought advisable to discontinue the practice of
holding these investigations. Escriche also quotes extracts from the
laws of August 24, 1799, September 26, 1835, and November 20, 1841,
wherein were provided regulations for the future continuance of the
<i lang="es">residencia</i>. Cases involving viceroys,
captains-general, and presidents of audiencias were to be tried in the
Supreme Tribunal of Justice in first instance. <i lang="es">Alcaldes
mayores</i>, <i lang="es">corregidores</i>, military and political
governors who were not presidents were to be tried in the audiencias
which exercised jurisdiction over their districts.</p>

<p class="footnote">The eminent authority, Manuel Bern&aacute;ldez
Pizarro, writing from Manila on April 26, 1827, deplored the laxity
which was characteristic of the method of conducting trials of <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>, and recommended that they be made more effective
and just. He criticized especially the prevailing system of holding the
<i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> to a strict accountability; who, he
wrote, &ldquo;as they have permission to trade, are more tempted to
evade or infringe the laws; and many persons are appointed to that
office &lsquo;who lack all the qualifications necessary for any public
office whatever,&rsquo; ... not only have they used their authority to
possess themselves of the property of the Indians ... and defrauded the
Indians with unjust exactions; but they have humiliated the religious,
stolen moneys from the king ... [and] have thrown the provinces into a
condition of effervescence and of conspiracy against the
government.&rdquo; (Blair and Robertson, LI, 212, 212&ndash;213.)
Pizarro recommended a more stringent <i lang="es">residencia</i> as a
means of remedying these defects.</p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER V</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE SEMI-JUDICIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS OF THE
AUDIENCIA.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Aside from the activities which have been described,
the magistrates of the audiencia rendered important services in various
administrative capacities. From the beginning until the end of the
eighteenth century the <i lang="es">oidores</i> were assigned to
special commissions or judgeships with jurisdiction over such
miscellaneous secular and ecclesiastical matters as did not come
readily under any other department or authority. In practically all
cases these functions involved the <i lang="es">oidores</i> in their
individual capacities rather than as magistrates of a tribunal of
justice. Though their work was independent of the audiencia, their
decisions were reviewed in the audiencia in many cases. In short, it
may be said that when any unforeseen or unclassified matter came up for
solution, it was usually assigned to a magistrate of the audiencia.</p>
<p>The exercise of these extra functions was especially characteristic
of the history of the audiencia down to 1785, when the reforms of the
intendancy were introduced throughout the Spanish colonial empire.
These important reforms grouped these administrative functions about a
central head, the superintendent, and lessened the duties of the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> in these matters, confining the magistrates
more particularly to judicial duties. It may be said, however, that the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> exercised these extra functions practically
till the end of the eighteenth century, which period comprised the
greater part of the existence of the colonial audiencia.</p>
<p>The laws of the Indies empowered the president of the audiencia to
designate <i lang="es">oidores</i> to serve on these commissions.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>Additional compensation and travelling expenses
were given for these extra services.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7434src" href="#xd21e7434" name="xd21e7434src">1</a> The
president was forbidden to send magistrates on commissions to places
outside the district of the audiencia, which, of course, would have
been impossible in the Philippines. Appointment to some of these
commissions was considered by the magistrates as highly desirable.
Frequent disagreements arose over these appointments, and the king was
obliged to issue pacificatory <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i>, from
time to time, to allay the discord and strife which arose over the
appointments to the more lucrative of these places. The principle was
laid down repeatedly that special commissions should be assigned fairly
among the ministers, and that in their distribution only the aptitude
of the magistrates for the particular tasks should be
considered.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7442src" href="#xd21e7442" name=
"xd21e7442src">2</a> The term of service for these special posts was a
year. No change was allowed in the incumbency of a particular
commission unless on account of death, sickness, or removal for
incompetency. Appointments to these extra duties were made in the royal
name, and appointees were obliged to make reports to the court on the
termination of the commission held. Magistrates were held responsible
for their service in this capacity in their <i lang=
"es">residencias</i>. In large audiencias such as Mexico, Lima, and
Buenos Ayres in the eighteenth century, many commissions of this
character were served by regular commissioners who held no other posts,
but in the smaller colonies such as the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and
Cuba, they were held by <i lang="es">oidores</i> when the duties
connected with the commissions did not entail sufficient work to occupy
all the time of the appointee.</p>
<p>The most important and profitable commissions were awarded to the
senior magistrate of the audiencia. He was charged <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>permanently with the duty of seeing that all the
decrees, fines, and decisions of the Council of the Indies were
executed, collections being made in accordance with the instructions of
that body. These included fines imposed in <i lang="es">residencia</i>
and other penalties exacted on different occasions by the audiencia, or
by the Council of the Indies. Among the latter were confiscations of
property and fines for smuggling, for the illegal exportation of
silver, and for the evasion of the king&rsquo;s fifth,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7468src" href="#xd21e7468" name="xd21e7468src">3</a>
the <i lang="es">alcabala</i> and the <i lang="es">almojarifazgo</i>.
The senior magistrate was authorized to retain as compensation three
per cent of the amount collected, and he was ordered to give account to
the audiencia of collections made by him in accordance with the
law.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7487src" href="#xd21e7487" name=
"xd21e7487src">4</a> Another magistrate was <i lang="es">asesor</i> of
the Santa Cruzada, and it was his duty to give legal advice and to act
as special attorney for that department of ecclesiastical
activity.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7495src" href="#xd21e7495" name=
"xd21e7495src">5</a> The president, <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, and the
senior <i lang="es">oidor</i> concurred in the <i lang=
"es">acuerdos</i> which treated of matters pertaining to <i lang=
"es">real hacienda</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7513src" href=
"#xd21e7513" name="xd21e7513src">6</a> This was known as the <i lang=
"es">junta ordinaria</i>. A tribunal of appeals above the <i lang=
"es">junta ordinaria</i> was created later, and in its activities,
also, the magistrates of the audiencia participated.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e7536src" href="#xd21e7536" name="xd21e7536src">7</a> The
audiencia also <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>heard judicially certain cases of appeal
involving the royal treasury, but magistrates who had participated in
the <i lang="es">junta</i> mentioned above were not allowed to hear
again the cases in which their previous vote had been given. Each
<i lang="es">oidor</i> served in turn for the period of six months on
the board of auctions.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7583src" href=
"#xd21e7583" name="xd21e7583src">8</a> Magistrates were appointed by
the governor, yearly, in turn, to serve as inspectors of the
government. In this capacity they were expected to examine and report
on the administration of justice and on the work of the audiencia, the
royal treasury and the officials connected therewith, visitors,
provincial officials and those of the city of Manila. The inspecting
magistrate was authorized to examine the records of these officials and
to use any other legitimate means in performance of his special
duties.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7588src" href="#xd21e7588" name=
"xd21e7588src">9</a></p>
<p>An <i lang="es">oidor</i> was designated by the president to make
periodical inspections in the provinces. This official had to attend to
a variety of matters while on visits of inspection. He was required to
make a census of the towns, and inquire into the prosperity of the
inhabitants; to audit the accounts of the town officials, and to see
whether the provincial governor or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164"
href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>magistrate had been faithful
in the execution of his duties. He was supposed to visit the <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i> and note the treatment of the Indians thereon, to
find out whether the natives were properly and sufficiently instructed,
or whether they were permitted to remain in idolatry and idleness. He
inspected the churches and monasteries, seeing that they contained the
requisite number of religious and no more, and noting whether the
natives under the charge of the ecclesiastics were well treated. In the
same way he inspected the curacies of the towns. The visiting <i lang=
"es">oidor</i> was especially required to give careful attention to the
<i lang="es">corregidores</i> and <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i>,
inspecting their judicial and administrative activities and holding
them responsible for any irregularities, especially with regard to the
treatment of the Indians. The visitor was required to inspect inns and
taverns, to ascertain whether they observed the regular tariffs, and
whether the drugs sold in the provinces were of good quality. He also
inspected highways and bridges. If the visitor found anything wrong he
was authorized to take immediate steps, on his own responsibility, to
remedy the defects, reporting any action taken to the audiencia without
delay. As seen in the last chapter, the immediate consequence of the
visit was frequently the <i lang="es">residencia</i> of the official
inspected. The visitor was provided with sufficient funds to defray his
expenses, so that he would not be a burden on the <i lang=
"es">encomenderos</i> or Indians. The president of the audiencia was
forbidden to order visits to the same province more frequently than
once every three years, unless, after an investigation, such action was
declared necessary by vote of the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7622src" href="#xd21e7622" name=
"xd21e7622src">10</a></p>
<p>The audiencia exercised supervision over certain matters of church
finance. These included tithes, the funds of temporalities, and of
certain charitable societies, and jurisdiction over the adjustment of
estates and properties left by deceased prelates. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>In
connection with the latter was the duty of auditing the accounts of
benefices which were subject to the royal patronage whenever a transfer
of occupants was made. These matters, though miscellaneous in their
character, and accordingly pertinent here, may be reserved for a
subsequent chapter which will be dedicated to a discussion of the
relations of the audiencia and the Church.</p>
<p>An <i lang="es">oidor</i> in the Philippines served as judge of
<i lang="es">medias anatas</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7639src"
href="#xd21e7639" name="xd21e7639src">11</a> These taxes were levied
upon the salaries of all officials of royal appointment, except
ecclesiastics, these exactions varying in amount from one-half the
first year&rsquo;s income to one-tenth of the gross salary of each
official. The <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of June 2, 1632,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7666src" href="#xd21e7666" name=
"xd21e7666src">12</a> ordered the judge-commissioner of <i lang=
"es">medias anatas</i> to surrender the money which he had collected to
the treasury officials who in turn were to transmit it to
Spain.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7675src" href="#xd21e7675" name=
"xd21e7675src">13</a> More definite information as to the nature of the
duties of the judge-commissioner of these funds may be gathered from
the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of December 14, 1776, by which Oidor
F&eacute;lix D&iacute;az Quejada y Obrero was appointed as commissioner
of <i lang="es">medias anatas</i> in the Philippines. This magistrate
was authorized to retain four per cent of all that he collected. This
percentage, the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> stated, was the same as
was paid to the commissioner of <i lang="es">medias anatas</i> of New
Spain. The <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> ordered Quejada to collect
this tax from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>all royal appointees, but not from governors of
towns or Indian <i lang="es">caciques</i> who were elected yearly, and
who, of course, were not royal appointees. Appeals from judgments of
the commissioner of <i lang="es">medias anatas</i> were to be
entertained in the Council of the Indies only, and not in the
audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7711src" href="#xd21e7711" name=
"xd21e7711src">14</a></p>
<p>It has been pointed out already in this chapter that the effect of
the reforms of the intendancy was to limit the jurisdiction of the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> over special commissions. This is especially
true of those relating to finance. An illustration of this is shown in
the disputes which occurred between the <i lang="es">oidores</i> and
the governor, over the conservatorships of betel,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7724src" href="#xd21e7724" name="xd21e7724src">15</a> wine,
tobacco, playing-cards, and cockpits. When these sources of income
developed in the latter part of the seventeenth century, their
supervision, as usual, had been conferred on <i lang="es">oidores</i>
with title of <i lang="es">asesores</i> or <i lang=
"es">jueces-conservadores</i> (judge conservators).<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e7737src" href="#xd21e7737" name="xd21e7737src">16</a> This was
done in disregard of the laws of the Indies, wherein was expressed the
desirability of conferring these assessorships, if possible, on
properly qualified officials, other than <i lang="es">oidores</i>. The
magistrate holding a commission was to attend to the legal duties and
adjudicate all suits in connection therewith. The latter regulation was
made in order that when the cases were brought to trial the magistrate
might not be incapacitated by having rendered decisions in them ahead.
The law continued in the following strain: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">when a case so urgent and extraordinary offers itself
that an <i lang="es">oidor</i> must be appointed, warning is hereby
given that ... the same magistrate who tried the case originally may
not be judge.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7758src" href="#xd21e7758"
name="xd21e7758src">17</a></p>
</div>
<p>This law conceded that <i lang="es">oidores</i> might serve when
other magistrates were not available.</p>
<p>Governor Marquina, <i lang="es">superintendente subdelegado de real
hacienda</i> from 1789 to 1793, refused to permit <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> to serve as <i lang="es">asesores</i> of the
monopolies of betel, wine, and tobacco. These magistrates claimed,
however, that they were entitled to the appointments, since they had
occupied these positions before July 26, 1784, the date of the creation
of the intendancy in the Philippines. They conceded that they had been
relieved of jurisdiction over these rents on that date, and that the
authority formerly exercised by them had been assumed by the
intendant.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7780src" href="#xd21e7780" name=
"xd21e7780src">18</a> By the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of November
23, 1787, however, the intendancy had been abolished and the government
restored to &ldquo;the state and condition which had previously
existed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7787src" href="#xd21e7787"
name="xd21e7787src">19</a> This would mean that the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> should again hold these <i lang=
"es">asesor&iacute;as</i>, and on the basis of this reasoning they
demanded that the governor should return them.</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">oidores</i> did not tamely submit to a deprivation
of their posts as <i lang="es">asesores</i> on the occasion of the
establishment of the intendancy. They complained to the king, alleging
that these appointments belonged to them by their own right. The king
inquired of Governor Basco y Vargas why the <i lang="es">oidores</i>
had not been designated for these duties. The governor replied that the
supervision of the rents had been assumed by the intendant, but that
their direction belonged at that time to the governor and
superintendent, by virtue of the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of
November 23, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>1787.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7818src" href=
"#xd21e7818" name="xd21e7818src">20</a> He stated that the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> had no right of their own to these <i lang=
"es">asesor&iacute;as</i>, since the faculty of appointing <i lang=
"es">asesores</i> had been conferred on the governor (or viceroy) by
the laws of the Indies,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7841src" href=
"#xd21e7841" name="xd21e7841src">21</a> and in times past governors had
appointed lawyers who were not <i lang="es">oidores</i>. There was
therefore no obligation on the part of the governor to give these
places to <i lang="es">oidores</i>; indeed, the laws of the Indies had
emphasized the undesirability of doing so.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7853src" href="#xd21e7853" name="xd21e7853src">22</a></p>
<p>Basco y Vargas, in pursuance of this conception of his rights and
duties, combined all of these <i lang="es">asesor&iacute;as</i> under
the direction of one office, placing them under the orders of his own
<i lang="es">asesor</i>, leaving <i lang="es">oidores</i> in charge of
each minor <i lang="es">asesor&iacute;a</i>, except that of tobacco,
which was placed under the immediate direction of the governor&rsquo;s
<i lang="es">asesor</i>. The king approved this action, giving the new
official a new title, that of <i lang="es">asesor de todo lo directivo
y lo econ&oacute;mico de la superintendencia subdelegada de la real
hacienda de Filipinas</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7877src" href=
"#xd21e7877" name="xd21e7877src">23</a> The local authority appointed
Magistrate Castillo y Negrete to this new position at once, but the
king, on the ground that the law<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7882src"
href="#xd21e7882" name="xd21e7882src">24</a> forbade an <i lang=
"es">oidor</i> to hold such an office, disapproved of the appointment
and gave the place to Rufino de Rivera, who had formerly been <i lang=
"es">auditor de guerra</i> and <i lang="es">asesor de gobierno</i>.</p>
<p>As soon as Governor Marquina assumed office, he relieved the
magistrates of the audiencia of all share in the administration of
these monopolies, combining all these branches of <i lang="es">real
hacienda</i> under the <i lang="es">asesor</i> above mentioned. On
August 3, 1791, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169"
name="pb169">169</a>]</span>the audiencia protested against the acts of
the governor, basing its claims to a continuance of authority on the
<i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of March 20, 1790, by which the king had
authorized the <i lang="es">oidores</i> to administer all the
monopolies except tobacco.</p>
<p>On August 16, 1791, Governor Marquina answered the complaint of the
audiencia in a memorial of his own, in which he set forth his position
in summarized form, giving a history of the entire contention, and
defining his position with precision and clarity.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7914src" href="#xd21e7914" name="xd21e7914src">25</a> He claimed
that the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> which had been issued up to
that time had recognized the right of the governor to dispose of these
<i lang="es">asesor&iacute;as</i>, which did not and never had belonged
to the <i lang="es">oidores</i> by their own right. As superintendent
of <i lang="es">real hacienda</i>, he (the governor) was
judge-conservator of all the <i lang="es">asesor&iacute;as</i>, and by
<i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of March 20, 1790, he had been
authorized to control them through his <i lang="es">asesor</i>. The
latter official had also been ordered to administer the rent of tobacco
directly as the agent of the governor and to supervise the others in
the governor&rsquo;s name. The <i lang="es">oidores</i> had been
forbidden to hold these positions, except under exceptional
circumstances, which, in Marquina&rsquo;s judgment, did not exist at
this time,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7942src" href="#xd21e7942" name=
"xd21e7942src">26</a> since there was present in the colony a special
<i lang="es">asesor</i> whose duty it was to supervise these
monopolies. The audiencia would have to try certain cases on appeal as
a judicial body, and <i lang="es">oidores</i> who had already rendered
decisions as judge-conservators could not justly render decisions when
the same cases were appealed. He declared that he had the approval of
the king in his contention, and was therefore confident of his
position.</p>
<p>The governor&rsquo;s will prevailed, and the magistrates were
deprived of the commissions which they had formerly held; these were
given over to regular officials of <i lang="es">real hacienda</i>.
Contentious cases, however, that did not pertain exclusively to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>finance were tried on appeal in the audiencia
and that body exercised regular, but not special, jurisdiction in them
thereafter.</p>
<p>One of the most important offices which the <i lang="es">oidores</i>
were called on to perform was that of <i lang="es">juez de
difuntos</i>. The duties of this office consisted largely in the
administration of the funds and property of persons who died intestate,
or without heirs in the colony. This work was entrusted to the colonial
audiencia as a body in 1526, and any judge therein might be delegated
from the tribunal for the adjustment of an estate.</p>
<p>The first law providing for a special administrator was proclaimed
at Valladolid on April 16, 1550. It stated that many of the heirs of
persons who died in the colonies had been defrauded of their rightful
dues by the carelessness, omission, illegal procedure, and usurpation
of the ministers who had diverted the property to their own uses; this
condition of affairs made reform imperative. Viceroys and presidents of
royal audiencias, while retaining power of removal for cause, were
commanded henceforth to name, at the beginning of each year, an
<i lang="es">oidor</i> from the local audiencia to act as <i lang=
"es">juez de difuntos</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7977src" href=
"#xd21e7977" name="xd21e7977src">27</a> This judge was authorized to
collect, administer, rent, sell, and have general supervision over the
property of deceased persons to the same extent that the audiencia
previously had. The acts of the judge were appealable to the audiencia
of the district wherein he officiated. On December 15, 1609, a law was
proclaimed by Philip III which extended the term of this judge from one
to two years. The early laws provided no extra salary for the <i lang=
"es">juez de difuntos</i>. It was prescribed that his decisions should
be respected by the audiencia and by the other officials of the
government, the viceroys and presidents being especially instructed not
to allow any other official to usurp his functions. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span></p>
<p>In case the <i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i> should fail to execute
his duties, or should exceed his powers, it was the duty of the
<i lang="es">fiscal</i> to bring the abuse to the attention of the
audiencia, and that tribunal was supposed to see that the proper
methods were enforced. The jurisdiction of this special magistrate was
to extend to the settling of the estates of intestates, and of testates
leaving property to persons in Spain. His authority was valid over the
property of deceased officials, merchants, and <i lang=
"es">encomenderos</i>, and it might be extended to the cases of
foreigners. He also assisted in the disposal of property left by
clerics. When the latter died intestate, the proceeds of their estates
were added to the fund known as the <i lang="es">bienes de
difuntos</i>. No distinction was made between property left by them and
that left by civil employees of the government or private citizens. If
these priests had made testaments, it was the duty of the <i lang=
"es">juez de difuntos</i> to see that the property reached the donees
without the interference of the prelates.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8004src" href="#xd21e8004" name="xd21e8004src">28</a></p>
<p>As in other cases noted in this and in former chapters, so in the
administration of the estates left by intestate decedents the laws seem
to have undergone considerable change. In 1526, Charles V ordered that
such estates were to be administered under the supervision of the
audiencia. In 1550, the place of special <i lang="es">juez de
difuntos</i> was created in each audiencia, the post to be filled by a
magistrate designated by the president. In 1653, Philip IV added to the
importance of the office by decreeing that all intestate cases should
be administered by a special <i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i>,
irrespective as to whether the heirs were in Spain, or at the place
where the death took place.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8017src" href=
"#xd21e8017" name="xd21e8017src">29</a> This law provided that if
children or descendants were left whose legitimacy was unquestioned,
the heirs being in the colony, or if a will legally attested and
witnessed were left, the case was to be settled in the ordinary courts.
If there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>were doubt, however, as to the validity of the
claims of persons representing themselves as descendants, or if there
were no heirs, the case would then be administered by the <i lang=
"es">juez de difuntos</i>. Settlements made by the ordinary justices
were not reviewed in the royal audiencia. The authority accorded them
frequently afforded pretexts for their intervention in cases which
should have been settled by the <i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i>,
particularly when heirs were left in Spain and in other colonies. A
number of disagreements arose over this point, but all doubt was
conclusively settled by the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of January
31, 1772, which awarded such jurisdiction to the <i lang="es">juez de
difuntos</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8037src" href="#xd21e8037"
name="xd21e8037src">30</a> This was confirmed by the law of September
28, 1797. Foreigners residing outside the dominions were not allowed to
inherit property left to them in the colonies, even though they were
lineal descendants.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8042src" href=
"#xd21e8042" name="xd21e8042src">31</a> Heirs or others claiming
property left by deceased persons must appear in person, or have others
appear for them, properly authorized, and must prove conclusively their
rights as heirs or creditors.</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of September 28, 1797, was a
codification and a reclassification of all previous laws on the subject
of this jurisdiction. The provisions of this law, briefly stated, were
as follows: (1) These judges should not under any circumstances have
jurisdiction over property left by will, or without will, when the
heirs were present and when there was no question of their right to the
property. (2) In order that these judges <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>have power of
intervention, it must be well known or appear by judicial process that
either all the heirs or the greater number of them were absent. (3)
They were not to have jurisdiction over property left by Indians or
<i lang="es">caciques</i>. (4) They should not usually have authority
to settle up the estates or property of native clerics, because their
heirs would presumably be present. These cases were therefore subject
to the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts, unless it were shown that
there were heirs in Spain. Under no circumstances should the
ecclesiastical authorities have intervention in these cases. (5) When
the heirs were present, the audiencia was ordered to enforce the law
which forbade the intervention of both the <i lang="es">juez de
difuntos</i> and the ordinary judge.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8069src" href="#xd21e8069" name="xd21e8069src">32</a> In these
cases the heirs were allowed to assume their property intact, without
its being sold and thereby costs incurred. (6) The practice which had
hitherto been followed by the <i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i> of
diverting a fifth of the property of those who died intestate for the
repose of the souls of the dead should cease from that time onward, and
the proceeds of said property should be handed over without deduction
to the heirs and relatives of the deceased, in accordance with the
<i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of June 20, 1766.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8082src" href="#xd21e8082" name="xd21e8082src">33</a> (7) The
<i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i> was forbidden to intervene in the
settlement of estates or property left to heirs by will.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8091src" href="#xd21e8091" name=
"xd21e8091src">34</a></p>
<p>It would appear, then, that the <i lang="es">oidor</i> detailed as
<i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i> had jurisdiction over cases of
intestacy, over the settlement of property when no heirs were apparent,
or when there was doubt as to the existence of heirs, and in cases
where <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>the designated testamentary donees were outside
the colony. The ordinary justices administered estates in two
capacities, namely, when testaments were to be executed, the heirs
being present, or when they acted as agents for the <i lang="es">juez
de difuntos</i>. The latter was privileged to call upon the <i lang=
"es">corregidores</i>, <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i>, and other
ordinary justices to execute provisions in the provinces, and these
officials were obliged, when so designated, to settle estates subject
to the supervision of the <i lang="es">juez</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8120src" href="#xd21e8120" name="xd21e8120src">35</a></p>
<p>When the heirs were resident in Spain, or in some colony other than
the Philippines, the estates of deceased persons were sold and the
money was set aside to be remitted to Spain. The collective sum of
these properties, sold and unsold, was designated as the <i lang=
"es">bienes de difuntos</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8130src" href=
"#xd21e8130" name="xd21e8130src">36</a> At stated periods the <i lang=
"es">juez de difuntos</i> was required to turn over the funds that he
had collected, or received in the execution of his duties, to the
<i lang="es">oficiales reales</i>, first deducting three per cent of
their gross amount for his services.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8141src" href="#xd21e8141" name="xd21e8141src">37</a> His
accounts, which were sent to the Council of the Indies, were also
audited by these officials, and the audiencia likewise held him
accountable for any abuses or errors other than financial. He was also
held responsible in his <i lang="es">residencia</i>. The <i lang=
"es">fiscal</i> was his prosecutor in case of suit. The <i lang=
"es">juez de difuntos</i>, on his part, was authorized to require
reports from the agents and administrators who served him in the
provinces, and all necessary safeguards were taken for his
protection.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8156src" href="#xd21e8156" name=
"xd21e8156src">38</a></p>
<p>Theoretically, the <i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i>, acting through
the <i lang="es">oficiales reales</i>, sent such money as he had
collected to the <i lang="es">Casa de Contrataci&oacute;n</i> of
Seville, or, after June 18, 1790, the date of the extinction of that
body, to the <i lang="es">juez de arribadas</i> in
C&aacute;diz.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8175src" href="#xd21e8175"
name="xd21e8175src">39</a> Thence it was distributed among the heirs in
various <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>parts of Spain, or, in case no heirs were found,
it was to remain in a fund by itself, until otherwise appropriated or
disposed of by the crown. The money was sent at the risk of the heirs,
eighteen per cent of the gross amount being deducted to pay the costs
of transfer.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8183src" href="#xd21e8183"
name="xd21e8183src">40</a> In actual practice, however, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>funds derived from the Philippines were retained
at Manila, itemized accounts of them being forwarded to Acapulco, the
proper amount being deducted there from the annual subsidy.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8290src" href="#xd21e8290" name=
"xd21e8290src">41</a> This rendered unnecessary the actual transfer of
money. The <i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i> in Mexico received the
funds from the Philippines, together with reports and accounts relating
thereto, and remitted them to Spain. There occurred many instances in
which this magistrate in Mexico found mistakes in the reports rendered
by his subordinate in Manila. A great deal of criticism was made from
time to time, of alleged irregularities in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>the
administration of these funds in the Philippines; in fact, successive
royal <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> repeatedly charged the Philippine
officials with maladministration.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8310src"
href="#xd21e8310" name="xd21e8310src">42</a> The general superintendent
of finance, Aparici, in a report to the Council, stated on July 19,
1797, that these funds had never been properly accounted for, and that
glaring defects&mdash;even dishonesty, had always existed.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8315src" href="#xd21e8315" name=
"xd21e8315src">43</a> These faults, he alleged, were owing to the fact
that the funds were not directly administered, but were paid into the
treasury of Mexico, and that because of this roundabout method direct
control could not be exercised. Although this high official pointed out
these defects and made recommendations for the betterment of the
service, no change was made, and the funds continued to be remitted to
Mexico until 1815, when the suspension of the regular galleon
eliminated the possibility of this practice.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8336src" href="#xd21e8336" name="xd21e8336src">44</a></p>
<p>The <i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i> was frequently opposed in the
exercise of his special jurisdiction by other officials of the colony.
Many cases involving these conflicts of jurisdiction were appealed to
the Council of the Indies. Among the most frequent were the quarrels
which took place between the captain-general <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span>and
the <i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i> over the question of the special
military jurisdiction of the latter, and the claim of the <i lang=
"es">juez de difuntos</i> to administer the property of military and
galleon officials. For example, on July 6, 1757, the <i lang=
"es">juez</i> appealed to the Council for jurisdiction over the
property of a deceased galleon official on the basis of the rights
conceded to him by the laws of the Indies;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8370src" href="#xd21e8370" name="xd21e8370src">45</a> the
governor claimed the right to administer this property on the ground
that the galleon officials were appointed by him, and that they were
held by the laws of the Indies to be under the military jurisdiction.
This case was decided in favor of the <i lang="es">juez de
difuntos</i>, and may be considered as having established a precedent
for his subsequent jurisdiction over such cases.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8378src" href="#xd21e8378" name="xd21e8378src">46</a></p>
<p>Probably the most notable case of conflict between the civil and
military jurisdictions and one which involved the <i lang="es">juez de
difuntos</i> occurred at the time of the death of the
lieutenant-governor and king&rsquo;s lieutenant, Pedro Sarrio. The
latter had left his property by will to his brother, the Marqu&eacute;s
de Algorja, a resident of Alicante. He had appointed a resident of
Manila as executor. The governor claimed that the right to administer
the property belonged to the executor. The <i lang="es">juez de
difuntos</i>, on the ground that Sarrio had left heirs in Spain,
contended that the funds should be administered by him, as the executor
did not have authority to transmit the property to Spain. This case was
carried to the Council of the Indies; no record appears of its ultimate
solution, but it is illustrative of the commonly accepted principle
that the <i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i> should have authority over
the administration of all property which had to be transmitted to Spain

"xd21e8394src" href="#xd21e8394" name="xd21e8394src">47</a> The
governor&rsquo;s contention against it was based on the fact that
Sarrio was a military official. As we have already seen, the law of
August 29, 1798, authorized the settlement of the property of soldiers
by special military courts.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8398src" href=
"#xd21e8398" name="xd21e8398src">48</a></p>
<p>Other sources of frequent dispute were the respective claims of the
<i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i> and the <i lang="es">oficiales
reales</i> for jurisdiction over property left by persons who were
indebted to the royal treasury at the time of their death. On the
occasion of the death of the <i lang="es">corregidores</i> of Tondo and
Ilocos, in 1776 and 1778, respectively, without having made wills, the
<i lang="es">oficiales reales</i> took steps to make an immediate
seizure of the property of the deceased officials. They demanded that
all documents and papers pertaining to the cases should be surrendered
at once into their hands in order that the amount owing to the
government might be collected. Governor Basco y Vargas interposed on
the ground that since these officials had died intestate, the
settlement of their property should be effected by the <i lang=
"es">juez de difuntos</i>; it being incumbent upon the <i lang=
"es">oficiales reales</i> to present the claims to the judge.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8424src" href="#xd21e8424" name=
"xd21e8424src">49</a></p>
<p>Shortly after this decision had been rendered, the <i lang=
"es">alcalde mayor</i> of Tayabas died, leaving a deficit of 7000
pesos, and the officials of the royal treasury immediately brought suit
in the audiencia on the basis of the laws of the Indies for
jurisdiction in the case prior to that of the <i lang="es">juez de
difuntos</i>. They alleged that the law provided that the treasury
officials should have precedence in collections, and that debts due to
the <i lang="es">real hacienda</i> should be settled prior to all
others. Moreover, they claimed that all officials should assist them in
making these collections and that no restrictions should be placed upon
their activities. Further evidence in support of the contentions of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>the treasury officials was submitted in the
substance of the royal <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of April 23,
1770, which declared that these judges should be entrusted exclusively
with the collection of royal funds. &ldquo;Furthermore,&rdquo; the
<i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> stated, &ldquo;if any case shall arise
which pertains to finance and at the same time to the <i lang="es">juez
de difuntos</i>, the latter may not make the advocation, because,
however favorable may be his jurisdiction, that of the royal treasury
is more favorable.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8452src" href=
"#xd21e8452" name="xd21e8452src">50</a> The <i lang="es">oficiales
reales</i> insisted that they should not be required to go before the
<i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i> for any purpose, since the laws of
the Indies<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8463src" href="#xd21e8463" name=
"xd21e8463src">51</a> gave them the power of inspecting the accounts of
the <i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i> and of keeping and administering
these funds.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8472src" href="#xd21e8472"
name="xd21e8472src">52</a> The more recent <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> of October 13, 1780, had decreed that the
accounts of the <i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i> should be approved by
the treasury officials, and on this basis they were able to advance
claims to seniority.</p>
<p>This dispute, though brought for adjudication before the audiencia,
was not settled by the tribunal. The evidence pertaining to the case
was collected and referred to the Council on December 22, 1786. The
<i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> which finally disposed of the matter was
issued May 4, 1794, in the following terms:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">It is indisputable that the ministers of our <i lang=
"es">real hacienda</i> are authorized to have jurisdiction over all
debtors of my royal treasury ... with preference to the ordinary
jurisdiction of the <i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i>, or to the judge
commissioned to settle property of intestates or to pay creditors; ...
the accounts of my <i lang="es">real hacienda</i> shall be settled by
my royal judges before the <i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i> may have
cognizance.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8503src" href="#xd21e8503" name=
"xd21e8503src">53</a></p>
</div>
<p>By this decree it was definitely established that the treasury
officials should have precedence over the regular judges in the
settlements of estates of officials and individuals against whom
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>the royal treasury had claims. After the demands
of the government were paid, those of private individuals might be
settled, and it was ordered that the <i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i>,
as the champion of individual claims, should always give precedence to
the <i lang="es">oficiales reales</i> who represented the interests of
the government.</p>
<p>The organization for the administration of these funds presented a
complete hierarchy. The actions of the <i lang="es">juez de
difuntos</i> were subject to review by the Audiencia of Manila. The
funds from the Philippines were deducted from the subsidy at Acapulco,
and forwarded to the <i lang="es">Casa de Contrataci&oacute;n</i> of
Seville (or the <i lang="es">juez de arribadas</i> at C&aacute;diz,
after 1790) by the <i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i> of Mexico. The
heirs in Spain were then found, and the money transferred to them, less
discounts covering costs of transmission to Spain. In case appeals were
made from the decision or settlement of the <i lang="es">juez de
difuntos</i>, the records of his proceedings in the case under
consideration were reviewed by the Council of the Indies. The method of
procedure there was to refer these documents and accounts to the
<i lang="es">Contadur&iacute;a General</i>, where all accounts for the
Council were audited and settled, and the recommendations of that
tribunal were accepted. The constitutional reforms of the nineteenth
century gave the audiencia increased authority in the final settlement
of these matters, and its decision was made final in practically all
contentious cases, though, of course, final judgments involving heirs
who were resident in Spain might still be appealed by them to the
Council of the Indies or the Supreme Tribunal of Justice.</p>
<p>Aside from the activities of the magistrates as members of the
<i lang="es">juntas de hacienda</i>, described earlier in this chapter,
it would perhaps be safe to assert that the tribunal exercised general
supervision over financial affairs in the colony until the time of the
establishment of the intendancy (1785&ndash;87). Correspondence between
the Council of the Indies and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182"
href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>Audiencia of Manila would
seem to indicate that the magistrates were expected to transmit, and
did send, in fact, reports on colonial finances to the Council of the
Indies. Among the reports of the <i lang="es">oidores</i> about twenty
of these periodical statements have been found, covering irregularly
the period from 1609 to 1780. No doubt a complete set exists. These
generally embody a detailed audit of the accounts of the <i lang=
"es">oficiales reales</i>. Numerous commissions were also sent to the
audiencia from time to time, ordering the magistrates to give special
attention to financial affairs, such as the collection of licenses from
Chinese; to see that tithes were efficiently collected and reported, to
see that the tax on metals (mined) was paid, and offering special
rewards in case of apprehension. It has already been shown that the
king on August 8, 1609, asked the audiencia whether the king&rsquo;s
fifth had been commuted to a tenth in the Philippines. On July 21,
1756, the audiencia reported on the number of ships that had entered
the harbor of Manila during the year before. On May 4, 1760, Francisco
Leandro de Viana, the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, charged the merchants of
Manila with wholesale fraud in the payment of the <i lang=
"es">almojarifazgo</i>, paying only 3% when the law of 1714, then in
force, had ordered the payment of 8%. Viana&rsquo;s report charged the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> with responsibility for this deliberate
violation of the law, alleging that the <i lang="es">oidores</i> had
been profiting thereby. It was on this occasion that the <i lang=
"es">fiscal</i> recommended the establishment of a <i lang=
"es">consulado</i> at Manila, which would remove from the magistrates
of the audiencia all temptation to use their positions for private
profit in violation of the commercial laws of the realm.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8571src" href="#xd21e8571" name=
"xd21e8571src">54</a> The part played by the magistrates in the
administration of the trade with Acapulco may also be mentioned here.
This will be discussed in a subsequent chapter.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8575src" href="#xd21e8575" name="xd21e8575src">55</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span></p>
<p>Apart from the extra duties and commissions already noted, the
audiencia was utilized for a variety of purposes which are too
miscellaneous to be classified, but too important to be omitted from
this discussion. Duplicates of executive orders relating to subjects
far removed from the jurisdiction of the audiencia as a court, were
sent to it, with instructions that the tribunal take note of numerous
matters, such as seeing that the laws were properly executed, observing
the effect of reforms, and reporting on their availability and
adaptability at various times and places. Copies of new laws relating
to civil and ecclesiastical affairs were sent to the audiencia for its
information.</p>
<p>The above practices were never more prominently evident than during
the constitutional reforms from 1810 to 1823.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8586src" href="#xd21e8586" name="xd21e8586src">56</a> That
period, of course, was a time of change and stress, and the audiencia
seems to have been regarded as the one stable authority in the
Philippines. <i lang="es">C&eacute;dulas</i> and executive orders were
issued to the audiencia without regard to the department of government
to which they applied. By the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of June
14, 1811, the audiencia was made responsible for the execution of all
the orders of the superior government. On March 18, 1812, oaths of all
civil and judicial officials were ordered to be administered by the
audiencia. A royal order was received by the Audiencia of Manila on
January 19, 1813, which forbade the existence of free-masonry in the
Islands. The audiencia was made responsible for the execution of all
these <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> and decrees. On August 6, 1813,
the tribunal acknowledged <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href=
"#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>receipt of the law of April 25,
1810, which forbade foreigners to land in the Islands without
passports. The audiencia was again made responsible for the execution
of the reforms of 1812, 1815, 1823, 1834, and 1835, by which the entire
administrative and judicial systems of the colony were reorganized.</p>
<p>The conduct of officials was continually under the observation of
the <i lang="es">oidores</i>, and special reports were frequently sent
to the Council from the audiencia in review of the progress of the
government in general, or in elucidation of some special phase of
it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8605src" href="#xd21e8605" name=
"xd21e8605src">57</a> A few more examples of these investigations which
were charged upon the <i lang="es">oidores</i> may be reviewed here,
together with the reports made by the magistrates in compliance with
royal instructions.</p>
<p>The king, on August 9, 1609, wrote to the audiencia, asking for
information concerning the truth of a certain report which had come to
him regarding a custom practiced among the natives before the arrival
of the Spaniards, and which was said still to be in operation. It had
been asserted that the children of a free man and a slave woman would
be half-slave and half-free, and the progeny of these children by
subsequent marriage would be classed as a fourth, an eighth, or a
sixteenth slave or free. It was said that the natives recognized
varying degrees of freedom and slavery. The king, in the letter above
referred to, expressed a desire to know the truth of these reports, and
he ordered the audiencia to instruct him fully concerning these alleged
practices and customs. He called attention to the existing law which
forbade Spaniards to hold slaves, and he requested information as to
how great a hold this barbarous custom had upon the natives, and how it
might be eradicated with the least possible inconvenience and
loss.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8613src" href="#xd21e8613" name=
"xd21e8613src">58</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href=
"#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span></p>
<p>The audiencia was required to submit data regularly concerning the
religious orders, showing the number of friars belonging to each order
and designating the provinces that were held by each. The tribunal was
often asked to make recommendations for the regulation of the
religious. As we shall note in a subsequent chapter, one of the regular
duties of the audiencia was to send in a yearly report on the number of
religious arriving in or departing from the Islands. The tribunal had
jurisdiction over the royal colleges and universities; it exercised
supervision over courses of study and instruction given in them, and
the <i lang="es">oidores</i> reported concerning these matters from
time to time.</p>
<p>The audiencia kept the court informed as to the number of Spaniards
in the Islands, the occupation of each, and his attitude toward the
government. It reported on the number of Chinese and other foreigners
in the Islands, the amount of tribute paid by the Chinese, and the
extent of the Chinese trade. From time to time the magistrates were
asked by the court to make special reports on these or other subjects.
They were required to report from time to time on the number and
services of the officials of the government, major and subordinate,
whether they were all needed, the quality of their services, and what
reforms could be made to effect greater economy and efficiency. The
audiencia was especially charged with the duty of seeing that the
provincial officials were not so numerous as to be a burden on the
natives. The government realized that oppression of the Indians would
result from the presence of too many Spaniards among them, and the
effort was continually made to limit the number of these undesirables.
The audiencia, in short, was the representative of the king in all
these matters.</p>
<p>On several occasions the audiencia assumed the initiative, or
assisted materially, in the accomplishment of various functions of an
extraordinary character. It played an important <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>role
in checking the epidemic of smallpox which ravaged the Islands from
1790 to 1794. On January 18, 1790, Governor Marquina reported that this
disease had been playing havoc with the Indians in various parts of the
Islands.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8628src" href="#xd21e8628" name=
"xd21e8628src">59</a> He had raised 2385 pesos by voluntary
contributions from different officials and corporations, and had
appointed a committee to administer the funds. This committee consisted
of representatives of the different religious communities and the
<i lang="es">consulado</i>, the archbishop, the chief of the <i lang=
"es">contadur&iacute;a</i>, the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, the regent and
the magistrates of the audiencia. Soon after this letter was written
Marquina&rsquo;s <i lang="es">residencia</i> was taken, and the king,
on January 24, 1794, wrote to the regent, asking him to act as
executive of the general committee already appointed to conduct the
campaign against this epidemic, and to report what progress had been
made in combatting it, suggesting that a general committee of
sanitation should be constituted to handle such cases in the
future.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8644src" href="#xd21e8644" name=
"xd21e8644src">60</a></p>
<p>In the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of November 26, 1765, we find
another illustration of the extraordinary functions of the magistrates
of the audiencia. The governor was ordered on this occasion to appoint
a committee to consider ways and means of remedying the damage done to
agriculture and commerce in the Islands as a result of the depredations
of the English upon their occupation of various parts of the Islands.
This committee was to consist of the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> as
president, the <i lang="es">oidores</i>, the chief of the <i lang=
"es">contadur&iacute;a</i>, the <i lang="es">alcaldes ordinarios</i> of
the city, and the <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> of the districts
immediately outside the city. It was ordered to meet at stated periods
to discuss and recommend ways and means of improvement, proper
taxation, and other measures calculated to bring about a revival of
agriculture. This committee was the forerunner of the <i lang=
"es">Sociedad <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>de Amigos del Pa&iacute;s</i>, which was
established during the administration of Governor Jos&eacute; Basco y
Vargas.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8675src" href="#xd21e8675" name=
"xd21e8675src">61</a></p>
<p>The variety of the functions of the audiencia is well illustrated by
a report made on July 20, 1757, in compliance with a royal order of
inquiry as to how much money should be expended by the Philippine
government on the inauguration ceremonies of the governor.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8686src" href="#xd21e8686" name=
"xd21e8686src">62</a> Besides noting an added duty of the tribunal,
this is illustrative of the pomp and ceremony utilized to impress the
inhabitants of the colonies with the grandeur of Spain and her
government. After a lengthy investigation, the audiencia stated in
reply that the government of Per&uacute; had been authorized to spend
12,000 pesos in the reception of a viceroy, while New Spain could spend
8000 pesos. As much as 4000 pesos had been spent in Manila in times
past. Since the Philippines was a colony of less importance than these,
and the governor there was of inferior rank to the viceroy, and as even
these sums were extravagant, it was the opinion of the tribunal that
the government at Manila should limit itself to an expenditure of 2000
pesos. This may be considered as an example of the work accomplished by
the <i lang="es">oidores</i> in checking the excesses of the other
officials and departments of the government.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8692src" href="#xd21e8692" name="xd21e8692src">63</a></p>
<p>The audiencia had general authority over the inspection and
censorship of books which were printed in the colony or imported. This
power was conceded by a series of laws promulgated at different times
from 1556 to 1668.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8703src" href=
"#xd21e8703" name="xd21e8703src">64</a> At the earlier <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>date
it was ordered that no book treating of the Indies should be printed
without first having been inspected, approved, and licensed by the
Council of the Indies, and none could be introduced into the Indies
without the express permission of that body.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8710src" href="#xd21e8710" name="xd21e8710src">65</a> Books of
fables and other profane publications were not allowed in the colonies
under any circumstances. The Council of the Indies, by enactment of May
8, 1584, authorized the audiencia to publish books and dictionaries in
the native dialects, and a later law stipulated that twenty copies of
each book should be sent to the Council of the Indies to be placed on
file there.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8715src" href="#xd21e8715" name=
"xd21e8715src">66</a> The <i lang="es">oidores</i> and the <i lang=
"es">oficiales reales</i> whose duty it was to inspect the ships which
arrived from New Spain were ordered to search for forbidden and
heretical books, but in doing this they must act in conformity with the
expurgatories of the Inquisition.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8739src"
href="#xd21e8739" name="xd21e8739src">67</a> By <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> of October 10, 1575, and of December 2, 1580,
the right to print books of prayer and of divine service for Spain and
the Indies was conceded to the monastery of San Lorenzo. This same
<i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> ordered that viceroys, presidents, and
<i lang="es">oidores</i> should see that no other service-books were
used in the churches and monasteries, and that books printed by any
other agency should not be permitted to enter the Islands.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8753src" href="#xd21e8753" name=
"xd21e8753src">68</a></p>
<p>In conformity with the above regulations, the Audiencia of Manila,
on July 21, 1787, suppressed a book which had been written by the
commissary of the Inquisition, on the ground that this functionary had
published it on the authority of the archbishop alone, and without
authorization of the Council of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>Indies, as was
required by law. The case was appealed by the commissary to the
Council, and the latter body, while approving the action of the
audiencia in suppressing the book, and reprimanding the archbishop,
after an examination of the volume, allowed its publication in
conformity with the laws of the Indies.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8762src" href="#xd21e8762" name="xd21e8762src">69</a> Taken
together, the relations of the audiencia and the commissary of the
Inquisition in most matters, and particularly in the publication of
books, were harmonious, and the same strife and trouble did not occur
in the Philippines that developed in Mexico, Naples, and Per&uacute;
over the question.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8767src" href=
"#xd21e8767" name="xd21e8767src">70</a></p>
<p>On January 26, 1816, the audiencia forbade the publication of any
book without its express permission.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8776src" href="#xd21e8776" name="xd21e8776src">71</a> As a
result, considerable trouble arose with the governor and the <i lang=
"es">fiscal</i>, neither of whom had been consulted when the <i lang=
"es">auto</i> was passed. The <i lang="es">fiscal</i> contended that
the audiencia was violating the law which had reserved to the Council
the power to give licenses for the publication of books; moreover, it
was asserted, the law required the governor and audiencia to act in
<i lang="es">acuerdo</i> in matters pertaining to the suppression and
licensing of books, the tribunal not being authorized to proceed alone.
The audiencia contended in reply that these laws could no longer be
interpreted to mean that the governor should have authority over
matters of a purely judicial nature, such as these were, because he was
no longer president of the audiencia, and hence not a judicial
official.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8794src" href="#xd21e8794" name=
"xd21e8794src">72</a> The tribunal furthermore based its <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>contention on two enactments&mdash;one, a royal
order dated October 1, 1770, which directed certain prelates to apply
to the audiencia for permission to have a religious work published, and
the other, dated July 21, 1787, already cited, by which the king
confirmed the refusal of the audiencia to allow the publication of a
work prepared by the commissary of the Inquisition, when he had failed
to seek the authority of the audiencia. It is clear, however, that on
this occasion the audiencia was guilty of deliberate misinterpretation
of the law in its own favor. The Council of the Indies had the final
right to decide as to the contents of the book, and the audiencia
merely suspended publication, pending the action of the Council. The
audiencia was never given the power to pass finally on the contents of
books, except those dealing with languages and dialects. The ultimate
right of passing on all religious publications was retained by the
Council of the Indies, while the audiencia was authorized merely to
suspend the publication and circulation of books which had not complied
with the above royal ordinances. After the suppression of the Council
of the Indies and the establishment of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice,
there was a tendency toward giving the colonial governments a wider
degree of latitude in such matters.</p>
<p>It has been noted already, in the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of
October 9, 1812, and in subsequent reforms, that all matters of a
contentious nature should be settled in the audiencias and not carried
to the tribunal in Spain. A further reform in the censorship of books
was made on October 4, 1839, when the control of these matters was
placed in the hands of two censors, appointed by the <i lang=
"es">acuerdo</i> and the archbishop, respectively. In case a decision
were made to suppress a certain book, a legal proceeding had to be
instituted before the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, who became the arbiter
if a disagreement arose between the censors. Seizure was justified on
the grounds that the publication contained something contrary to the
legitimate interests of the throne or of the religion. Condemned books
were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>not only seized, but sent from the
colony.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8823src" href="#xd21e8823" name=
"xd21e8823src">73</a> The responsibilities of censorship were thus
shared until October 7, 1856, when, on account of the many
disagreements which had arisen as a result of this divided authority,
the superior government decreed that a standing board of censors should
be created, to consist of eight members, four to be appointed by the
archbishop and four by the governor. This board was to be presided over
by the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> of the audiencia.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8830src" href="#xd21e8830" name="xd21e8830src">74</a></p>
<p>Among other important functions of a non-judicial character was the
audiencia&rsquo;s duty of keeping the archives of the government. The
tribunal had a number of records in which entries were made concerning
its work.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8837src" href="#xd21e8837" name=
"xd21e8837src">75</a> A registry was kept of the votes of the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> in suits involving a hundred thousand <i lang=
"es">maraved&iacute;s</i> or more. Further, separate records were kept
of all resolutions of the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> relative to
government and finance, respectively, Thursday afternoon of each week
being devoted to the latter. Likewise, a book of <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dulas</i> and royal provisions was kept by the audiencia,
and on the basis of these the tribunal formed all judgments and gave
advice when requested. Separate files were kept for copies of all royal
orders, <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> and letters, one for secret,
and the other for open correspondence. In another volume an account was
kept of the amounts received from fines and from funds liquidated for
the expenses of justice. As already stated, lists were also maintained
of all persons residing in the colony, with an account of their quality
and work, their attitude toward the government, their occupation, and,

Other duties will be noted in connection with the relation of the

religious and the ecclesiastical institutions of the colony, and merit
special treatment in that connection. The audiencia, moreover, had
extensive functions in relation to the commercial and economic life of
the colony. A fuller comprehension of these numerous activities may be
gained in the following chapters where they are discussed in connection
with two of the most powerful factors in the colony&rsquo;s

the <i lang="es">junta superior de la real hacienda</i>, created for
Manila by the law of July 24, 1784. It was one of the reforms of the
intendancy. It cannot be said, however, that these reforms became
effective until 1787, though the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> of
July 17 and 24, 1784, which ordered them, were received in Manila on
December 5, 1785. These <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> ordered the
formation of a government locally, which would conform to the general
principles of the intendancy and which were laid down in the <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dulas</i> referred to. These plans had to be referred to
Spain on appeal. Subsequently the Ordinance of Intendants of Buenos
Ayres was applied to the Philippines.&mdash;A. I.,
107&ndash;5&ndash;14. Until January 11, 1791, all appeals from the
<i lang="es">junta superior</i> were heard in the Audiencia of Manila.
The <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of that date, received in Manila on
June 30, 1793, ordered that such appeals should be carried to the
Council of the Indies.&mdash;A. I., 107&ndash;5&ndash;22. The <i lang=
"es">junta superior de real hacienda</i> did much toward relieving the
audiencia of its advisory functions as in matters of finance and
commerce. Many evidences of this may be noted in the reports and
correspondence of the <i lang="es">superintendente de real hacienda de

(<i lang="es">Jos&eacute; de G&aacute;lvez</i>, 338&ndash;9) shows that
even after the establishment of the intendancy in New Spain, the
audiencia retained the administration of crown lands, notwithstanding
the provisions of the new laws which ordered that they should be
controlled by the <i lang="es">junta superior</i>. See also

ordered the confiscation of property left by foreigners, forbidding
that it should be sent outside of the realm either by the <i lang=

accordance with this regulation the superintendent, in 1800, seized the
property of a Spaniard who had married a lady of Madras. The Spaniard
had left a will providing for the transfer of his property to his wife,
naming an executor to administer the will. This was opposed by the

action of the superintendent was approved (Aguilar to Soler, July 8,

<p class="footnote">Another illustration of the disposal of money left
under slightly different circumstances may be noted in the Royal Order
of February 14, 1800, to the <i lang="es">juez de arribadas</i> at
C&aacute;diz. The king ordered the transmission of 8024 pesos to the
royal treasury because of the impossibility of finding the heirs of
Antonio Manuel Pereda, who died at Manila in 1767. By the terms of his
will, 2000 pesos had been left to the Third Order of St. Francis, 200
pesos to poor widows and orphans, and the balance was left to his
mother. The lady had died, however, and as there were no heirs
apparent, the money was ordered transferred to the royal treasury (A.
I., 107&ndash;3&ndash;9).</p>
<p class="footnote">These large sums, constantly on hand, intact and
available, were always a source of grave temptation to governors and
treasury officials. Loans were frequently taken from this fund for
ordinary or unusual expenses of the government. At first the <i lang=
"es">juez de difuntos</i> objected forcibly to the governor&rsquo;s
seeming disregard of the royal instructions regarding these funds. The
laws of the Indies had commanded that they should be held inviolable
(<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>, 57, 70). As noted above, the
practice had arisen of making deductions from the subsidy equivalent to
the amount of <i lang="es">bienes de difuntos</i> produced in the
Philippines, and of retaining the money in Acapulco. This practice
worked havoc with the fulfillment of the law which had ordered that
these funds be preserved intact. The governor and the treasury
officials had fallen into the practice of appropriating such available
funds as existed in the <i lang="es">caja de difuntos</i> for purposes
of local administration, with the assurance that the money would be
properly accounted for in Mexico. Governor Anda seems to have been a
leading offender in this matter. In 1767 he borrowed 19,729 pesos from
the <i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i> and in 1768 another sum of 30,000
pesos was taken (Landazurri to the Council of the Indies, May 22, 1770,
A. I., 107&ndash;3&ndash;9). By the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of
October 9, 1777, the king approved the action of Governor Anda in
borrowing from these funds on three other occasions to the extent of
25,000, 14,206, and 24,477 pesos, respectively, for the fortification
of the city. It was ordered that this should not be done again,
however, except under extraordinary circumstances (A. I.,
107&ndash;3&ndash;9).</p>
<p class="footnote">After being permitted for a long period of time,
the practice which the Manila authorities had followed of making these
deductions was finally disapproved by the home government. In 1806,
because of the non-arrival of the galleon with the subsidy, the
governor (and superintendent) authorized an advance of 54,049 pesos
from the <i lang="es">bienes de difuntos</i>, which sum constituted the
entire amount on hand. On April 25, 1815, the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>
of the <i lang="es">contadur&iacute;a general de las Indias</i> handed
down an adverse opinion on this action (A. I., 107&ndash;3&ndash;9).
Although the practice of allowing small loans from the funds of
deceased persons had been practiced in the Philippines in case of
exceptional circumstances, it was his opinion that the whole proceeding
had been contrary to the laws of the Indies (<i lang=
"es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>, 2&ndash;32&ndash;57). He advised that in
the future there should be no interference with this money until the
deduction had been authorized by the <i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i>
in Mexico, and the judge should act only after he had received the
report of the corresponding official in the Philippines.</p>
<p class="footnote">If the above advice were followed, at least a year
would pass before the report of the Manila judge could reach Mexico,
and be returned. It was not to be supposed that the officials in the
Philippines would wait for any such formality when in need of money for
the current expenses of government. This is another example of the
cumbrousness and lack of expedition of Spanish colonial administration,
as affected by time and distance. It will be noted, also, that this
practice had been going on since the time of Anda (1768), and the
Council of the Indies did not pronounce against it decisively until
1815. The particular litigation which brought about its condemnation
arose in 1806 and continued throughout a period of nine years.</p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE AUDIENCIA AND THE GOVERNOR: GENERAL RELATIONS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The audiencia was brought into closer and more
frequent relationship with the governor than with any other authority
in the colony. The governor was president of the royal audiencia and
hence was nominally its chief magistrate. This brought him into touch
with its functions as a court. The governor was chief executive of the
colony, and in that capacity was responsible for administrative,
financial, and military affairs. It will be noted that the audiencia,
in various ways, exercised powers of intervention in all of these
matters.</p>
<p>The official title of the governor of the Philippines up to 1861 was
governor, captain-general, and president of the royal
audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8884src" href="#xd21e8884" name=
"xd21e8884src">1</a> a combination of three important functions. In his
capacity as governor, he was chief executive of the civil government,
with authority over all administrative departments, including finance,
and over ecclesiastical affairs. As <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb194" href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>captain-general, the
governor was commander-in-chief of the military forces, with the
special duty of providing for the defense of the Islands. As president
of the audiencia, the governor retained his authority as executive
while entering the field of the judiciary. Though he could not act as
judge, himself, nevertheless we have seen in former chapters that he
exercised extensive authority over the tribunal, its procedure, and its
magistrates.</p>
<p>It will accordingly be our aim in this chapter to discuss the
general relations of the audiencia and the governor. These include
administrative, financial, and ecclesiastical functions, and those
involving the government of the provinces. To these will be added such
further observations as remain to be made concerning the judicial
relations of the governor and audiencia, leaving apart for discussion
in another chapter as an integral subject, the military jurisdiction
and the respective participation of the audiencia and the governor in
the matter of defense.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the governor of the Philippines occupied the
same relative position, within and without the colony, as did the
viceroy in New Spain, and during the greater part of the history of the
Islands he was independent of the government of New Spain and was
responsible to the Spanish court directly, in the same manner as the
viceroy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8909src" href="#xd21e8909" name=
"xd21e8909src">2</a> The independence of the Philippine government may
be said to have been practically complete, with such exceptions as will
be mentioned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>in a subsequent chapter, treating of the
<i lang="la">ad interim</i> rule, after the re-establishment of the
audiencia in 1598. The governor was the chief administrative official
of the colony, and the provincial governments derived their authority
from him; he was the royal vice-patron, and in this capacity he bore
the same relation to the church in the colony as the king did to the
church in Spain. Likewise as the king was the theoretical head of the
state, and was limited and assisted in the exercise of his authority
over the empire by the Council of the Indies, so the governor and
captain general of the Philippines (and the viceroy in New Spain and
Per&uacute;) was the head of the colony, and was limited by the
audiencia. The audiencias of all the colonies were equally dependent on
the Council of the Indies.</p>
<p>Professor Bourne very aptly characterizes the office of governor of
the Philippines and its relations to the audiencia. He writes:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The Philippine Islands were constituted a kingdom and
placed under the charge of a governor and captain general, whose powers
were truly royal and limited only by the check imposed by the Supreme
Court (the <i lang="es">Audiencia</i>) and by the ordeal of the
<i lang="es">residencia</i> at the expiration of his term of office.
Among his extensive prerogatives was his appointing power which
embraced all branches of the civil service in the islands. He also was
<i lang="la">ex officio</i> the President of the <i lang=
"es">Audiencia</i>. His salary was $8000 a year, but his income might
be largely augmented by gifts or bribes. The limitations upon the power
of the Governor imposed by the <i lang="es">Audiencia</i>, in the
opinion of the French astronomer Le Gentil, were the only safeguard
against an arbitrary despotism, yet Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, a generation
later pronounced its efforts in this direction generally
ineffectual.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8953src" href="#xd21e8953"
name="xd21e8953src">3</a></p>
</div>
<p>Juan Jos&eacute; Delgado, who gives us perhaps the most
comprehensive and realistic survey of the Philippines of any of the
ecclesiastical historians of those Islands, describes the nature of the
office of governor as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The governors of these Islands have absolute authority
to provide and to attend to all that pertains to the royal estate,
government, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>war; they have consultations in different
matters with the <i lang="es">oidores</i> of the royal audiencia; they
try in the first instance the criminal causes of the soldiers, and they
appoint <i lang="es">alcaldes</i>, <i lang="es">corregidores</i>,
deputy and chief justices of all the Islands for the exercise of
government, justice, war, ... and besides many other pre&euml;minences
conceded by royal decrees to the presidency of the royal audiencia and
chancery.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8972src" href="#xd21e8972" name=
"xd21e8972src">4</a></p>
<p>The governors of these Islands [he wrote] are almost absolute, and
are like private masters of them. They exercise supreme authority, by
reason of their charge, for receiving and sending embassies to the
neighboring kings and tyrants, ... they can make peace, make and
declare war, and take vengeance on those who insult us, without
awaiting any resolution from the Court for it. Therefore many kings
have rendered vassalage and paid tribute to the governors, have
recognized them as their superiors, have respected and feared their
arms, have solicited their friendship, and have tried to procure
friendly relations and commerce with them; and those who have broken
their word with them have been punished.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8980src" href="#xd21e8980" name="xd21e8980src">5</a></p>
</div>
<p>The governor of the Philippines, like the viceroy of New Spain, was
the administrative head of the colony, and as such exercised
supervision over all the departments of the government, likewise over
ecclesiastical affairs. He was directed to devote himself to the
service of God, and to labor for the welfare of the souls of the
natives and inhabitants of the provinces, governing them in peace and
quietude, endeavoring to bring about their spiritual and moral uplift
and their numerical increase. The governors (or viceroys) were
instructed by the laws of the Indies <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">to provide all things which are convenient for the
administration and execution of justice, ... to maintain the government
and defense of their districts, exercising very special care for the
good treatment, conservation and augmentation of the Indians, and
especially the collection, administration, account and care of the
royal exchequer.</p>
</div>
<p>They were instructed, in short, to do all for the provinces under
their charge<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8995src" href="#xd21e8995"
name="xd21e8995src">6</a> that the king, himself, might do. The laws of
the Indies ordered the audiencia, the religious authorities and the
civil officials to acknowledge the governor [or viceroy] as their
chief. The laws emphasized as the special duties of the governor the
supervision and augmentation of the finances, the defense of the
colony, and general supervision over all officials, executive and
judicial, central and provincial.</p>
<p>Foremost among the responsibilities of the executive was that of
supervising the administration of the colonial exchequer. In this,
however, he was assisted by the audiencia. The customary <i lang=
"es">oficiales reales</i> were among the first officials created for
the Philippine government, and they were responsible to the governor.
At the time of the creation of the audiencia, it was ordered that the
governor and two <i lang="es">oidores</i> should audit the accounts of
the <i lang="es">oficiales reales</i>, but this power was transferred
to Governor Dasmari&ntilde;as when the audiencia was removed in 1589.
In 1602 the right of inspection of accounts was returned to the
<i lang="es">oidores</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9014src" href=
"#xd21e9014" name="xd21e9014src">7</a> but the governor, it was stated,
as executive head of the government, was responsible, and he exercised
direct intervention in these matters, limited only by the annual
inspection of the <i lang="es">oidores</i>. During the greater part of
the history of the Islands the governor exercised supervision over the
collection and the administration of the public revenue, in accordance
with the law,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9021src" href="#xd21e9021"
name="xd21e9021src">8</a> and he was required to be present at the
weekly meetings of the <i lang="es">junta de hacienda</i>, of which two
magistrates <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>were members, there to pass on all financial
measures and to authorize expenditures.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9031src" href="#xd21e9031" name="xd21e9031src">9</a> The governor
had control over the sale of offices, jointly with the <i lang=
"es">oficiales reales</i>, but from the correspondence on these
subjects it is clear that the audiencia was designed to check the
governor&rsquo;s authority in that particular.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9040src" href="#xd21e9040" name="xd21e9040src">10</a> The
governor was forbidden to authorize extraordinary expenditures from the
treasury without express royal permission, except in cases of riot, or
invasion.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9043src" href="#xd21e9043" name=
"xd21e9043src">11</a> This regulation was almost impossible of faithful
execution, and as his duties increased and became more complicated, the
governor was unable to give as complete attention to these matters as
the laws of the Indies prescribed. Although the governor had these
financial powers, he could not decide cases appealed from the <i lang=
"es">oficiales reales</i>. These were regarded as contentious cases and
as such were resolved by the audiencia.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9051src" href="#xd21e9051" name="xd21e9051src">12</a> In Mexico
and Lima, wherein there were higher tribunals of accounts than in
Manila (<i lang="es">contadur&iacute;a mayor</i>), the audiencia did
not have this jurisdiction.</p>
<p>From 1784 to 1787 the governor was temporarily deprived of the
leadership in financial matters by virtue of the Ordinance of
Intendants, but the <i lang="es">oidores</i> retained membership in the
colonial board of audits, together with the intendant, who had taken
the governor&rsquo;s former place as the responsible head of the
colony&rsquo;s finances. In 1787 the governor was restored to his
former position with respect to the exchequer, with the official title
of <i lang="es">superintendente subdelegado de real hacienda</i>. It is
sufficient to say that the governor&rsquo;s relation to this new
department did not materially lessen the authority of the audiencia
with regard to the finances of the colony.</p>
<p>Although the appointing power was claimed by many governors
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>as their sole prerogative, the audiencia imposed
a very decided check on their exercise of this authority. The governor
had the right to make appointments in all departments of the
government, except in certain so-called offices of royal designation,
to which the governor made tentative appointments, subject to
subsequent royal confirmation.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9072src"
href="#xd21e9072" name="xd21e9072src">13</a> Although the law of
February 8, 1610, exempted appointments made by the governor of the
Philippines from the necessity of royal confirmation,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e9083src" href="#xd21e9083" name="xd21e9083src">14</a> in
practice these nominations were sent to the court for approval in the
same manner as were those from Spain&rsquo;s other colonies.</p>
<p>The audiencia intervened in the matter of appointments in two ways.
In case it succeeded to the government on the death of the governor the
tribunal exercised all the prerogatives of appointment.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9090src" href="#xd21e9090" name=
"xd21e9090src">15</a> When the governor was present he was obliged to
refer the names of all candidates to the <i lang=
"es">acuerdo</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9098src" href="#xd21e9098"
name="xd21e9098src">16</a> This was made necessary because the
governor, being new to the Islands and unfamiliar with local
conditions, was not so well fitted to pass upon the merits of
candidates for office as were the <i lang="es">oidores</i> who had
become permanently identified with the interests of the colony and
whose opinion was of weight in these matters. Thus it came about that
the audiencia exercised joint authority with the governor in making
appointments.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9106src" href="#xd21e9106"
name="xd21e9106src">17</a> The question of the relative authority of
the audiencia and governor in making appointments was a source of
conflict throughout the history of the Islands.</p>
<p>When the governor submitted the name of a candidate to the <i lang=
"es">acuerdo</i> it was the duty of the magistrates to furnish all
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>the information possible regarding the
character, fitness, and ability of the person under consideration for
the position. If the audiencia and the governor should disagree and the
latter still persisted in an appointment, it was the duty of the
audiencia to submit, forwarding all evidence relative to the candidate
to the Council of the Indies, the latter body ultimately taking such
action as it deemed best. When the nominations of the governor reached
the Council of the Indies for confirmation, that tribunal relied
extensively upon information furnished by the audiencia concerning the
candidates under consideration.</p>
<p>As already stated, the king retained the right to appoint certain
so-called &ldquo;officials of royal designation.&rdquo; These varied at
different times, but, in general, included <i lang=
"es">corregidores</i>, <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i>, <i lang=
"es">oficiales reales</i>, <i lang="es">oidores</i>, regents, and, of
course, viceroys, governors, and captains-general.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e9130src" href="#xd21e9130" name="xd21e9130src">18</a> All
these officials, except those last named, could be temporarily
designated by the executive. Although the law placed <i lang=
"es">corregidores</i>, <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i>, and <i lang=
"es">oficiales reales</i> in this category, their designation by the
court, like the confirmation of <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>, was
usually nominal. Many of these offices were filled in Spain and Mexico,
while some appointees were named from the Philippines, and probably in
the majority of the latter cases the royal appointment merely amounted
to a confirmation of a temporary appointment made by the governor. The
post of governor of the Philippines was filled temporarily by the
viceroy of New Spain until about 1720. In the same manner the governor
of Ternate was named by the Philippine executive, with the advice and
consent of the audiencia. These <i lang="la">ad interim</i>
appointments were valid until the king made them regular by
confirmation, or sent persons from Spain to hold them permanently.</p>
<p>When a vacancy occurred among the offices of royal designation,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>it was the governor&rsquo;s duty to forward a
list of candidates, or nominees, and from this list the king, or the
Council of the Indies in his name, made a permanent
appointment.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9155src" href="#xd21e9155"
name="xd21e9155src">19</a> In the meantime a temporary appointment was
often made by the governor, in <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> with the
audiencia, and the name of the appointee was placed first on the list
remitted to the court. This procedure was followed in the appointment
of <i lang="es">encomenderos</i>, <i lang="es">corregidores</i>,
<i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i>, and treasury officials. It was
seldom done in the cases of <i lang="es">oidores</i> and <i lang=
"es">fiscales</i>, who, because of their special or professional
character, were usually sent directly from Spain or from New Spain.
Unless there were special reasons to the contrary, for instance, the
filing of an adverse report by the audiencia, or a protest on the part
of residents, the governor&rsquo;s temporary appointments were usually
confirmed and made permanent. Temporary appointees with salaries
exceeding 1000 pesos a year only received half-salary until their
appointments were confirmed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9179src" href=
"#xd21e9179" name="xd21e9179src">20</a> At least two years and
frequently four transpired before the regular appointment arrived, and
as the terms were from three to five years for the majority of these
offices, the governor&rsquo;s candidate was usually the incumbent a
considerable portion of the time, whether his nomination were confirmed
or not. Neither relatives nor dependents of governors or <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> could be legally appointed to any office.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9190src" href="#xd21e9190" name=
"xd21e9190src">21</a> This mandate was often violated, as we shall see.
It was the duty of the regent and the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> to
certify to the court that appointees were not relatives of the governor
or <i lang="es">oidores</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9202src" href=
"#xd21e9202" name="xd21e9202src">22</a></p>
<p>In an instruction directed exclusively to the Philippine audiencia,
the king ordered the tribunal to see that offices were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>bestowed only upon persons &ldquo;who by fitness
or qualifications are best able to hold them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e9211src" href="#xd21e9211" name="xd21e9211src">23</a> It
appears that this law, or another promulgated about the same time, gave
to the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> and the <i lang="es">oidores</i> the
right to pass on the qualifications of <i lang="es">encomenderos</i>,
<i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i>, <i lang="es">corregidores</i>, and
other minor officials, on condition that preference should be given to
conquerors, settlers, and their descendants. Governor Alonso Fajardo
remonstrated that this new practice hampered the work of the governor,
and created difficulties between him and the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9233src" href="#xd21e9233"
name="xd21e9233src">24</a> A yet later law, dated October 1, 1624, gave
the governor (and viceroy) the right to make temporary appointments of
all judicial officials, without the interposition of the
audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9236src" href="#xd21e9236" name=
"xd21e9236src">25</a> On February 22, 1680, the power of making
permanent appointments of <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> and

"xd21e9248src">26</a> In view of this law, the Audiencia of Manila
claimed and actually exercised authority in the appointment of
provincial officials from that time onward.</p>
<p>Vacancies in the audiencia itself were filled temporarily by the
governor. In case the audiencia were governing <i lang="la">ad

cases, but the power of the audiencia, as provided by these laws, was
secondary to that of the governor if he were present. Under no
circumstances were permanent appointments to the audiencia to be made
by any authority other than the king and Council. In case there were a
vacancy in the office of <i lang="es">fiscal</i> the junior <i lang=

of February 8, 1610, above cited, was always quoted as furnishing
justification for the appointment of <i lang="es">oidores ad
interim</i> by the governor.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9323src" href=
"#xd21e9323" name="xd21e9323src">30</a> In a subsequent chapter we
shall refer to several occasions on which this was done; indeed, entire
audiencias were re-constituted by certain governors.</p>
<p>The audiencia was required to see that the appointees designated by
the governor duly complied with the requirements of <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>; likewise that they were properly installed in
office, and that they did not serve in offices for which they had
neither authority nor qualifications.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9333src" href="#xd21e9333" name="xd21e9333src">31</a>
Notwithstanding the variety and the conflicting character of the laws
bearing on matters of appointment, a careful consideration of law and
practice leads to the conclusion that the governor, as chief executive,
had the power of making appointments, but in the execution of this duty
he was ordered to consult the audiencia, although, strictly speaking,
he was not obliged to follow its advice. If there were good reasons for
not appointing an official recommended by the governor, the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> could send representations to the Council of the
Indies, setting forth their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href=
"#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>objections, and the Council might
confirm or nullify the appointment, as it chose. The audiencia could
make appointments if it were in temporary charge of the government. The
authority which the audiencia exercised in regard to appointments
varied according to circumstances. If the governor were new at his
post, weak or indulgent, the audiencia exercised more extensive
authority than was conceded by the laws. If the governor were
experienced, efficient, and a man of strong personality and dominating
character, the tribunal exercised less power in regard to appointments,
and, in fact, in all other matters pertaining to government.</p>
<p>Closely related to the appointing power was the duty which the
governor had of submitting annually to the court a list of all the
officials of the colony, with comments on the character of their
services, and with recommendations for promotion or dismissal from
office.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9345src" href="#xd21e9345" name=
"xd21e9345src">32</a> The <i lang="es">oidores</i> were included in
these reports.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9353src" href="#xd21e9353"
name="xd21e9353src">33</a> It was also the function of the governor to
report on the administration of justice.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9358src" href="#xd21e9358" name="xd21e9358src">34</a> The
governor was instructed to inform the court in case the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> engaged in forbidden commercial ventures, either
directly, through the agency of their wives, or through other
intermediaries.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9367src" href="#xd21e9367"
name="xd21e9367src">35</a> He was authorized, moreover, to investigate
and report on the public and private conduct of the magistrates and of
their wives as well<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9372src" href=
"#xd21e9372" name="xd21e9372src">36</a> and to exert himself to see
that their actions were at all times in consonance with the dignity of
their rank and positions and of such a character as would reflect
credit on the royal name <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href=
"#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>and entitle them to the respect of
the residents of the colony. The confidential reports of the governor
to the king might include all of these matters, and many others too
numerous to mention. On the other hand, the audiencia, as a body, was
authorized to direct the attention of the Council to any irregularities
of which the governor might be guilty, and thus a system of checks and
balances was maintained.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9380src" href=
"#xd21e9380" name="xd21e9380src">37</a> However, the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> were forbidden to make charges individually. This
injunction was so frequently disregarded that it was practically a
dead-letter.</p>
<p>Typical of the governor&rsquo;s authority over all the officials of
the colony, and incidentally over the <i lang="es">oidores</i>, was his
power to grant or withhold permission to marry within the colony. The
earlier laws on this subject absolutely forbade viceroys, presidents,
<i lang="es">oidores</i>, <i lang="es">alcaldes</i>, or their children
to marry within their districts.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9399src"
href="#xd21e9399" name="xd21e9399src">38</a> Deprivation of office and
forfeiture of salary were the penalties for infraction of these
regulations. These laws were followed by others which required the
president (viceroy or governor) to report immediately to the Council
the case of any magistrate guilty of violating the law forbidding the
marriage of officials.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9404src" href=
"#xd21e9404" name="xd21e9404src">39</a> It was not until 1754 that a
law was promulgated providing for special marriage dispensations to be
granted by the Council of the Indies upon the recommendation of the
president of the audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9410src" href=
"#xd21e9410" name="xd21e9410src">40</a> In 1789 the president was
authorized to concede permission to accountants and treasury officials,
but not to <i lang="es">oidores</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9421src" href="#xd21e9421" name="xd21e9421src">41</a> The
prohibition <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>was applied to magistrates until 1843, and the
only condition under which they were permitted to marry within the
colony was by virtue of the express permission of the supreme tribunal
in Spain. In 1848, the president of the audiencia was authorized to
grant marriage licenses to magistrates on condition that the
contracting parties were &ldquo;of equal quality, customs, and of
corresponding circumstances,&rdquo; permission having first been
obtained from Spain,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9428src" href=
"#xd21e9428" name="xd21e9428src">42</a> the president alone passing
upon the requisite qualifications.</p>
<p>The chief reason for the restrictions and prohibitions placed on the
marriage of magistrates seems to have been the conviction that officers
of justice would compromise themselves by marriage, acquiring vast
numbers of relatives and dependents, thereby making it impossible to
render impartial decisions or administer justice as evenly and
dispassionately as they would were they not so familiarly known in
their districts. It was also necessary to prevent officials from
lowering their dignity by union with natives and half-castes. The
marriage of officials with natives of the Philippines was not regarded
with favor at any time by the Spanish government.</p>
<p>It seems that the above prohibition did not apply with the same
force to <i lang="es">fiscales</i> as to magistrates. This is
illustrated by a case which arose in 1804 when Fiscal Miguel
D&iacute;az de Rivera was deprived of his office by royal decree for
having married without the permission of the Council of the
Indies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9442src" href="#xd21e9442" name=
"xd21e9442src">43</a> The <i lang="es">fiscal</i> had married the
daughter of the <i lang="es">corregidor</i> of Pangasin&aacute;n, who
was a colonel in the Spanish army. The mother of the girl was a
Eurasian from Madras, and had been a subject of Great Britain. Under
the date of May 27, 1805, D&iacute;az sent a petition to the king,
bearing the endorsement of Governor Aguilar, demanding his restoration
to office. Among <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207"
name="pb207">207</a>]</span>the reasons cited for the proposed
reinstatement of the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, it was said that
D&iacute;az, being a prosecutor and not a magistrate, was not subject
to the same regulations and conditions as the <i lang="es">oidores</i>,
whose judicial duties rendered impossible their marriage within the
Islands. Aguilar stated that the purpose of the law had been to debar
ministers from making such marriage connections as would diminish the
respect which the community should have for them as <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> of a royal audiencia, thus undermining their standing
as magistrates. In this instance there could have been no case of
degradation because of the high standing of the mother and father.
Moreover, a <i lang="es">fiscal</i> could not be regarded as a
magistrate, and the same laws did not apply to both classes of
officials. As an outcome of these representations D&iacute;az was
restored to office by the royal decree of October 13, 1806.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9466src" href="#xd21e9466" name=
"xd21e9466src">44</a></p>
<p>A duty similar to that just noted, inasmuch as it was indicative of
the authority of the governor over the <i lang="es">oidores</i>, was
his power to examine and try criminal charges against the magistrates.
A law which was in force from 1550 to 1620 ordered that the president
should be assisted in the trial of criminal charges against <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> by <i lang="es">alcaldes ordinarios</i>. On September
5, 1620, this law was modified by the enactment of another, which
ordered that in cases involving imprisonment, heavy fines, removal from
office, or the death penalty, the governor should make the
investigation and refer the <i lang="es">autos</i> to the Council of
the Indies for final judgment.</p>
<p>This law still left the trial of <i lang="es">oidores</i> for
misdemeanors in the governor&rsquo;s jurisdiction, but in cases of
sedition or notorious offenses which required immediate action in order
to furnish a public example for its effect on the natives, the
president was required to confer with the audiencia, and to act in
accordance with its judgment. By this law the president was forbidden
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>to make more than temporary suspensions of
<i lang="es">oidores</i> from their offices. In no case could they be
permanent unless first approved by the Council of the Indies.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9493src" href="#xd21e9493" name=
"xd21e9493src">45</a> Notwithstanding this law, it may be noted that
certain governors went so far on some occasions as to remove, imprison,
and exile magistrates and to appoint a new audiencia.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e9499src" href="#xd21e9499" name="xd21e9499src">46</a> The
judicial power of the governor over such cases was further altered by
the Royal Instruction of Regents of June 26, 1776, by which he was
forbidden to impose any penalty on the <i lang="es">oidores</i> without
the concurrence of the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> and the
regent.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9515src" href="#xd21e9515" name=
"xd21e9515src">47</a> The president and the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i>
could rebuke and discipline <i lang="es">oidores</i>, privately, when
their conduct demanded it. Even on such an occasion as this the
magistrate was to be given full opportunity to defend himself. If a
private investigation of the conduct of an <i lang="es">oidor</i> were
necessary, the inquiry could be still conducted by the senior
magistrate.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9530src" href="#xd21e9530" name=
"xd21e9530src">48</a> <i lang="es">Oidores</i>, on the other hand, had
no jurisdiction over the trial of charges against the president, unless
it were in his <i lang="es">residencia</i>. In this event the
investigation might be conducted by a magistrate designated by the
governor or by the Council of the Indies.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9541src" href="#xd21e9541" name="xd21e9541src">49</a></p>
<p>Aside from his executive and military duties, the governor was
president of the royal audiencia. This arrangement had the advantage of
giving him an opportunity to know and appreciate the legal needs of the
colony. It brought him in constant contact with judicial minds, and his
position in this regard was no doubt calculated to keep him in the
straight and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>narrow path of the law. Nevertheless, the
governor, who was usually a soldier, but seldom a lawyer, did not
participate as a magistrate in the trial of cases, and his activities
in the tribunal were directive, rather than judicial. His opinions in
all legal and administrative matters were prepared by his <i lang=
"es">asesor</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9551src" href="#xd21e9551"
name="xd21e9551src">50</a></p>
<p>As president of the audiencia the governor exercised two important
powers. One authorized him to divide the audiencia into <i lang=
"es">salas</i> and to designate <i lang="es">oidores</i> to try cases
within the tribunal, to inspect the provinces, to take <i lang=
"es">residencias</i>, or to attend to semi-administrative matters, such
as have been noted in the preceding chapter.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9622src" href="#xd21e9622" name="xd21e9622src">51</a> The other
was the power to decide whether a contention was of judicial,
governmental, military, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href=
"#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>or ecclesiastical character, and
to assign it to the proper department or tribunal.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e9630src" href="#xd21e9630" name="xd21e9630src">52</a> This
power was significant because it made the governor the supreme arbiter
between all conflicting authorities in the colony. Frequently he
decided disputes between the audiencia and the ecclesiastical courts,
between the audiencia and the <i lang="es">consulado</i>, or between
the <i lang="es">oidores</i> and the <i lang="es">oficiales reales</i>
in matters relative to the jurisdiction of these tribunals over
questions at issue.</p>
<p>While the magistrates were allowed to proceed practically without
interference in affairs of justice, the governor was instructed to keep
himself informed concerning the judicial work of the
audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9646src" href="#xd21e9646" name=
"xd21e9646src">53</a> While forbidden to alter the judgments of the
tribunal or to tamper with its sentences,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9651src" href="#xd21e9651" name="xd21e9651src">54</a> he could
excuse or remit fines with the consent of the <i lang="es">oidores</i>.
The governor could commute sentences in criminal cases. The final
pardoning power rested with the king and it was exercised upon the
recommendation of the governor or the prelates<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9668src" href="#xd21e9668" name="xd21e9668src">55</a> and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>the Council of the Indies. There were
exceptional occasions, however, on which the governor assumed the
responsibility of pardoning criminals.</p>
<p>After the creation of the office of regent in the audiencias of the
colonies, in 1776, the governor&rsquo;s position as president of the
audiencia became purely nominal, the regent actually officiating as
chief justice, though the president was still legally required to affix
his signature to all judicial decisions of the tribunal. The frequent
and extended absences of the governor from the capital and the
multiplicity of his administrative duties prevented him from attending
to these matters with requisite promptness, and injustice consequently
resulted from the requirement. Many complaints were made from 1776
onward against this condition of affairs, with the result that a
modification in the existing law was made on October 24, 1803, making
valid the signature of the regent to all decisions of the audiencia,
when the governor was absent from the colony on expeditions of conquest
or tours of inspection.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9677src" href=
"#xd21e9677" name="xd21e9677src">56</a> At all other times the
governor, as president, affixed his signature to all legal acts and
<i lang="es">autos</i>, although he did not participate in their
decisions. The law remained thus until 1861, when the governorship was
separated from the presidency, the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> was
abolished, and the regent was made president of the audiencia with
authority to sign all judicial decisions.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9689src" href="#xd21e9689" name="xd21e9689src">57</a></p>
<p>We have already noted that the governor exercised special judicial
powers, independent of the audiencia. Among these the military
jurisdiction stands pre-eminent, and it will be discussed separately in
the following chapter. The governor was also empowered to try Indians
in first instance, with appeal to the audiencia.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9697src" href="#xd21e9697" name="xd21e9697src">58</a> The actual
trial of these cases, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href=
"#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>however, was delegated to the
<i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> and <i lang="es">corregidores</i>
with appeal to the audiencia. It was impossible for the governor,
occupied as he was with the multitudinous affairs of his office, to
concern himself personally with the thousands of petty cases among the
Indians, or between Indians and Spaniards. He had jurisdiction over
suits involving the condemnation of property through which public roads

name="xd21e9715src">59</a> The special jurisdiction of the governor,
assisted by the audiencia, over cases affecting the royal
ecclesiastical patronage will be discussed later.</p>
<p>The laws of the Indies would seem to indicate that both the governor
and the audiencia exercised independently the power to exile
undesirable residents from the colony. It was stipulated that if
sentence of exile were passed by the governor and the offenders were
sent to Spain, the necessary papers, issued by the governor, should
accompany them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9722src" href="#xd21e9722"

commute the sentence or otherwise interfere in the matter.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9727src" href="#xd21e9727" name=
"xd21e9727src">61</a> The audiencia frequently sentenced criminals or
other undesirables to spend terms of varying lengths in the provinces
or in the Marianas. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213"
name="pb213">213</a>]</span>This, as we have seen, was commonly one of
the trials connected with the residencia. We have a noteworthy
illustration of the action of the audiencia in <i lang="es">acuerdo</i>
with the governor in the banishment of Archbishop Felipe Pardo, who was
exiled by the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> of the audiencia and Governor
Juan de Vargas Hurtado, in 1684. Vargas was succeeded the same year by
Governor Curuzaelegui, who recalled the prelate from exile and forced
the audiencia to endorse the act of recall.</p>
<p>Closely related to the governor&rsquo;s jurisdiction over banishment
was his jurisdiction over cases of persons entering the Islands or
departing from them without royal permission.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9742src" href="#xd21e9742" name="xd21e9742src">62</a> He
exercised final jurisdiction here over civil and ecclesiastical
authorities, <i lang="es">encomenderos</i>, and private persons. The
law forbade any person to enter or leave the Islands without the royal
permission, and the governor was charged with the execution of this
law. <i lang="es">Encomenderos</i> were not to leave the Islands on
pain of confiscation of their <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9756src" href="#xd21e9756" name=
"xd21e9756src">63</a> While the laws of May 25, 1596, and of June 4,
1620, gave authority to the governor over the religious, relative to
their entrance into the Islands and departure therefrom,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9760src" href="#xd21e9760" name=
"xd21e9760src">64</a> the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of July 12,
1640, authorized the audiencia to enforce the law on this subject;
especially was the tribunal to see that no ecclesiastics departed for
Japan and China without the proper authority.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9768src" href="#xd21e9768" name="xd21e9768src">65</a> Although
there can be no doubt of the finality of the governor&rsquo;s
jurisdiction in this matter, yet the audiencia exercised an advisory
power, and an authority to check irregularities, particularly with a
view to seeing that the governor did his duty and fulfilled his
obligations in the matter. Numerous instances exist to show that
whenever this subject was treated in a royal order or decree, copies of
the law were sent to the audiencia <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214"
href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>for its information. On other
occasions when there was reason to believe that there had been
irregularities in the procedure of a governor, the audiencia complained
to the Council of the Indies. This was done for example in 1779 when
Governor Sarrio conceded permission for several priests to go to
Mexico. This action the audiencia claimed to be irregular, since the
Council of the Indies had not been notified or consulted. The king, on
March 6, 1781, approved the action of the governor on the basis of the
laws above referred to.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9775src" href=
"#xd21e9775" name="xd21e9775src">66</a></p>
<p>Besides his judicial authority the governor shared legislative
functions with the audiencia. We have noted in an earlier chapter that
the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> passed ordinances for the domestic welfare
and local government of the colony. It prescribed rules and issued
regulations for merchants, <i lang="es">encomenderos</i>, and
religious, in accordance with the rulings for royal ecclesiastical
patronage. The <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> developed from the advisory
power of the audiencia. The king in his first decrees ordered the
viceroys and presidents to consult with the <i lang="es">oidores</i>
whenever the interests of the government demanded it,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e9793src" href="#xd21e9793" name="xd21e9793src">67</a> and if
necessary the opinions of the magistrates could be required in writing.
When an agreement was reached upon a given subject, they voted in
<i lang="es">acuerdo</i> and gradually that <i lang="es">acuerdo</i>
came to have the force of law. On many occasions the <i lang=
"es">acuerdo</i> prevailed over the governor&rsquo;s will. There was no
constitutional basis for this, and the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i>, when
it became a legislative function in passing ordinances and overruling
the governor himself, assumed prerogatives which were never exercised
by the audiencias of Spain.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9811src" href=
"#xd21e9811" name="xd21e9811src">68</a></p>
<p>The laws of the Indies established the governor as the sole
executive, and forbade the audiencia to interfere with the
government.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9819src" href="#xd21e9819" name=
"xd21e9819src">69</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href=
"#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>The governor, occupied by his
extensive administrative and military duties, came to devote less
attention to the judicial side of his office, which was left almost
entirely to the audiencia. So it developed that the <i lang=
"es">acuerdos</i> in reference to judicial matters&mdash;the
establishment of tariffs and rules for their observance and the
dispatch of <i lang="es">pesquisidores</i> and visitors to the
provinces, came in the latter eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
to be increasingly the concern of the audiencia. The authority of the
tribunal in these matters was recognized by the Constitution of 1812
and the reforms made in pursuance thereof.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9832src" href="#xd21e9832" name="xd21e9832src">70</a></p>
<p>In the same manner the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> came to be
recognized in governmental and administrative matters. The enactments
of these legislative sessions of the audiencia were known as <i lang=
"es">autos acordados</i>. They ultimately came to embrace a wide field.
The audiencia passed laws for the regulation of the provinces; it made
rulings which the <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> and <i lang=
"es">corregidores</i> were to follow in the collection of tribute; it
prescribed their relations with the parish priests; it issued
regulations for the conduct of the friars and the ordinary clergy
relative to the royal patronage. Laws were passed for the encouragement
of agriculture and industry and the regulation of commerce. Rice,
tobacco and silk culture, the production of cinnamon and cocoanuts, the
breeding of fowls, the regulation of cock-fighting, cloth-making and
ship-building all came in for their share of attention in the <i lang=
"es">acuerdo</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9881src" href="#xd21e9881"
name="xd21e9881src">71</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href=
"#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span></p>
<p>The audiencia, in the exercise of the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i>
power, passed ordinances for the enforcement of the laws forbidding the
unauthorized departure of persons from the Islands; it helped to fix
the rate of passage on the galleons and on the coast-wise ships. It
made regulations for the Chinese in the Pari&aacute;n, it prescribed
the conditions under which licenses might be issued to Chinese
merchants and it passed ordinances for the better enforcement of the
laws prohibiting the immigration of the Chinese. The <i lang=
"es">acuerdo</i> concerned itself with the maintenance of prisons and
the care of prisoners, the <i lang="es">residencias</i> of provincial
officials, the auditing of accounts, the collection of the revenue, and
the supervision of the officials of the treasury. Ordinances were
passed enforcing the general law which ordered that the natives should
not live together in Christian communities without marriage, that they
should attend religious ceremonies, that they should be instructed in
religion, and that they should not be exploited, either by the civil or
ecclesiastical authorities. It is, of course, understood that the
audiencia in no way trespassed the authority of the church in issuing
these regulations; indeed it was quite the contrary; these ordinances
were passed on the basis of the authority of the royal patronage, with
the design of assisting the vice-patron (the governor) in the execution
of his duties, and the church was aided rather than impeded thereby. It
must be remembered, of course, that the governor, as president of the
audiencia, presided in these <i lang="es">acuerdos</i>, and that in
most cases, actually, as well as in theory, these <i lang="es">autos
acordados</i> were his will. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href=
"#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span></p>
<p>There were many occasions in the history of the Islands when the
<i lang="es">acuerdo</i> was influential in the formulation of
far-reaching reforms. The well-known &ldquo;Ordinances of Good
Government,&rdquo; issued by Governor Corcuera in 1642 for the
observance of the provincial officials, and repromulgated with
modifications by Cruzat y G&oacute;ngora in 1696 and by Ra&oacute;n in
1768 were formulated by the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i>.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e9930src" href="#xd21e9930" name="xd21e9930src">72</a>
<span class="corr" id="xd21e9936" title=
"Source: Similarily">Similarly</span> were those formulated that were
proposed by Marquina in 1790. The local regulations for the <i lang=
"es">consulado</i>, established in 1769, were formulated by the
audiencia largely on the recommendations of the able <i lang=
"es">fiscal</i>, Francisco Leandro de Viana. In the same manner the new
plan of constitutional government given to the Philippines in 1812 was
drafted by the audiencia at the request of the Council of the
Indies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9946src" href="#xd21e9946" name=
"xd21e9946src">73</a> Likewise the plans for the government of the
intendancy were submitted to the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> by Governor
Basco y Vargas in 1785. Indeed, these, as well as the scheme of
1787&ndash;8, were actually written by two magistrates of the
audiencia, the former plan by Oidor Ciriaco Gonzales Carvajal,
subsequently intendant, and the latter by Oidor Castillo y
Negrete.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9957src" href="#xd21e9957" name=

<p>There were occasions when the audiencia enacted administrative
measures in which the governor failed to participate. These were
especially noticeable during the administrations of Acu&ntilde;a,
Fajardo, and Corcuera&mdash;governors who spent much of their time away
from Manila. A more recent instance of this occurred in 1790 when the
natives of the province of Ilocos revolted against a tyrannical and
dissolute <i lang="es">alcalde mayor</i>. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span><i lang="es">acuerdo</i>, notwithstanding the
objection of Governor Marquina, removed the offending official and
appointed another, and this action was subsequently approved by the
king.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9972src" href="#xd21e9972" name=
"xd21e9972src">75</a> According to the laws of the Indies the authority
of removal and appointment of such officials rested with the
governor.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9975src" href="#xd21e9975" name=
"xd21e9975src">76</a> The tendency of the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> to
act in civil affairs without the advice or presence of the governor was
checked by the royal order of November 12, 1840, wherein the audiencia
was ordered not to attempt to carry its <i lang="es">acuerdos</i> into
execution without the authority of the superior government.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9987src" href="#xd21e9987" name=
"xd21e9987src">77</a> The evil effects of the audiencia&rsquo;s
intervention in provincial government were pointed out in 1842 by
Sinibaldo de Mas, when he wrote: &ldquo;the government of the provinces
is in charge of an alcalde-mayor, who is at once judge of first
instance, chief of political matters, subdelegate of the treasury, and
war-captain or military commandant, for whose different attributes he
is subject to authorities distinct from one another.&rdquo;<a class=

<p>The audiencia was deprived of its <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> power
<span class="corr" id="xd21e10023" title="Source: in in">in</span>
governmental matters by the Constitution of 1812, but it was still
retained in judicial affairs. In 1815 and again in 1823 on the
restoration of the monarchy, the full <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> power as
practiced before 1812 was resumed by the audiencia. Official
recognition of the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> was made publicly by
Governor Torres, who succeeded Enrile on March 18, 1834. In his
inaugural address this governor avowed his purpose to be the extension
and improvement of commerce, the army and agriculture, &ldquo;but, in
order to develop these to their highest extent, and to realize the
utmost success in my administration,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I count on
the co-operation of all the authorities, and particularly of the
<i lang="es">real acuerdo</i>, of which I have the honor to be
president.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10036src" href=
"#xd21e10036" name="xd21e10036src">79</a> The audiencia was finally
excluded from the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> in administrative matters by
the reform of July 4, 1861; since then the tribunal has been purely

been assumed by the Administrative Council (<i lang="es">Consejo de
Administraci&oacute;n</i>) of which the president and <i lang=
"es">fiscal</i>, and usually two <i lang="es">oidores</i> at least were
members. Thus, even after the reform of 1861, the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> continued to participate in legislative functions,
though the audiencia as a body did not.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10057src" href="#xd21e10057" name="xd21e10057src">80</a></p>
<p>Typical of the multitudinous duties of the governor, and
illustrative at the same time of his relations with the audiencia, were
the various subjects treated in the Instruction of the king to Governor
Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a, dated February 16, 1602,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10070src" href="#xd21e10070" name="xd21e10070src">81</a> which is
chosen for citation here because of its comprehensive character, and
also because of its availability. Beginning with the reminder that the
governor should confer with the Viceroy of New Spain whenever
necessary, this comprehensive paper treated first of the defense of the
Islands against the Japanese, and of the maintenance of a garrison in
Mindanao. The matter of tribute was taken up, and the desirability was
shown of having the natives pay tribute in kind rather than in money.
It was said that the latter method encouraged the natives to indolence,
for as soon as they had earned enough money to pay their tribute they
ceased work altogether. The governor was advised to consult with the
audiencia in regard to this matter. The king ordered the governor to
cut down expenses and to economize by the elimination of as many
offices as possible. He recommended, in particular, the abolition of
the offices of <i lang="es">corregidor</i> and <i lang="es">alcalde
mayor</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span></p>
<p>The king warned Acu&ntilde;a against a continuation of the
dishonesty of past governors in the lading of ships for New Spain. He
declared that thereafter the allotment of freight should not be left to
the friends of the governor, but the matter should be personally
supervised by the governor and an <i lang="es">oidor</i>. The frauds
which had been common also in the assignment of <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i> in the colony must cease; to effect this the
governor was temporarily deprived of jurisdiction over this matter. Who
was to assign the <i lang="es">encomiendas</i> in the future was not
divulged.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10091src" href="#xd21e10091" name=
"xd21e10091src">82</a></p>
<p>The governor was instructed to see that the salable offices were not
conferred on the relatives of the <i lang="es">oidores</i>, nor given
to his own relatives, but that they should be disposed of to persons
offering the most money for them. It had been charged that governors
and audiencias had connived together in the past to deprive persons of
offices to which they were legitimately entitled. This had been done by
allowing favorites to hold more than one office, and by favoritism in
the sale of these positions. These abuses must be stopped, the king
said; it was ordered that in the future no person should be allowed to
hold more than one office, that as many of these as possible should be
sold, with unrestricted competitive bidding.</p>
<p>The governor and the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> were ordered to
exercise care and diligence in the inspection of the returning galleon,
to see especially that it brought no unregistered money from persons
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>in Mexico. Acu&ntilde;a&rsquo;s predecessor,
Tello, had recommended that west-bound galleons should stop at the
Ladrones to leave priests and soldiers, and to minister to the needs of
Spaniards already there. This was authorized and the governor was
instructed to see that it was done. The governor was also ordered on
this occasion to make an investigation of the audiencia. Complaints had
been coming to the court for a long time against the laxity of the
tribunal in the administration of justice, and of the commercial
activities of the <i lang="es">oidores</i>. The governor was to aid the
<i lang="es">fiscal</i> in the prosecution of any <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> who were remiss, to the extent of sending them under
arrest to New Spain if the charges against them justified such
action.</p>
<p>This Instruction, it will be noted, required the governor to
intervene actively in practically all the governmental affairs that
came up in the colony. He was to exercise authority with regard to
defense, finance, and revenue. He was to exercise supervision over
provincial affairs so as to insure the good treatment of the natives
and the beneficent administration of the <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>.
He was to give his attention to the galleon trade and to the disposal
of offices within the colony. If doubt or difficulty arose in any of
these matters of administration, he was to demand from the audiencia,
its assistance, counsel, and support. The governor was also authorized
to see that justice was administered effectively, though he was not to
intervene directly in that matter, except to see that abuses were
<span class="corr" id="xd21e10133" title=
"Source: erradicated">eradicated</span>. This Instruction shows that
the governor was regarded as the chief executive of the government. He
was the responsible head in the judicial, administrative, and military
spheres. The audiencia, on the other hand, had consultative functions,
aimed to assist the governor when he required it, but to restrict him
when he sought to exceed his powers. Instructions similar to this were
given to many succeeding governors. A citation of these would prove
nothing new, however.</p>
<p>In the same manner that the Instruction to Acu&ntilde;a gives us
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>an idea of the relative functions of the
audiencia and the governorship in 1602, so the criticisms of the able
Spanish diplomat, Sinibaldo de Mas, written in 1842, aid us in
estimating their respective spheres in the nineteenth century. This
opinion is valuable because it summarizes the result of two hundred and
fifty years of the interaction of these political institutions in the
Islands. Mas showed the reason for the establishment of the intendancy,
and the conferring of added powers upon the audiencia and criticized
the relations existing between the governor and these institutions in
the following terms:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">To set some balance to his power (that of the
governor), because of the distance from the throne, certain privileges
and pre&euml;minences have been granted to other persons, especially to
the Audiencia, even to the point of making of the latter a court of
appeal against the measures of the chief of the islands. Besides, the
revenues have been removed from his jurisdiction, and the office of the
intendant has been constituted, who obeys no others than the orders
communicated to him by the ministry of the treasury from Madrid. It is
very obvious that this single point is quite sufficient to paralyze
completely the action of the governor-general. Besides, since there are
many matters which require to be passed on by distinct ministries, it
happens that two contrary orders touch the same matter, or that one
order is lacking, which is enough to render its execution impossible
... a chief may detain a communication, even after he has received it,
if it does not suit him. This system of setting obstacles in the way of
the governor of a distant colony is wise and absolutely necessary, ...
there results rather than a balance among the various departments of
authority a confusion of jurisdictions, the fatal fount of eternal
discord.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10143src" href="#xd21e10143" name=
"xd21e10143src">83</a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mas made extensive quotations which were calculated to show
&ldquo;the great confusion and contrariety of the orders to governor
and audiencia.&rdquo; This characteristic of the laws of the Indies has
repeatedly been referred to in this treatise, and we shall note its
results in a subsequent chapter dealing with the conflicts of
jurisdiction between the audiencia and the governor.</p>
<p>It is clear, therefore, that the decision of the governor was not
final in administrative affairs. Persons dissatisfied with his
executive actions or decisions in such matters were privileged to
appeal to the audiencia. If the findings of the tribunal differed from
those of the governor, and if the governor were still unyielding, his
will was to be obeyed but the case was thereupon appealed to the
Council of the Indies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10154src" href=
"#xd21e10154" name="xd21e10154src">84</a> If the case were one of law
and justice the governor, on the other hand, was instructed to abide by
the decision of the audiencia, but he was privileged to carry the case
to the Council of the Indies. Thus it was that each of these
authorities had a sphere wherein its word was law, and its decisions
final in the colony.</p>
<p>It was prescribed, however, that when there were differences of
opinion between the governor and the audiencia an effort should be made
both by the governor and the audiencia to avoid notorious disagreements
which would furnish a bad example to the natives, or otherwise degrade
the dignity of the royal tribunal or governor. Viceroys, presidents,
and audiencias were forbidden to take action in cases wherein there was
doubt as to their jurisdiction, or wherein there was a question as to
the advisability of taking final action.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10161src" href="#xd21e10161" name="xd21e10161src">85</a></p>
<p>It would appear, therefore, from this survey of the laws, that the
audiencia was provided with ample means for restraining the action of
the governor. This it could do either by admonition, by appealing from
his decisions in administrative <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225"
href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>matters, or by blocking him
in the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i>. It was evidently the design of those
who planned the legislation of the Indies to guard at all times against
the excesses of an all-powerful executive. Such was certainly the
purpose of the establishment of the audiencia, both in the Americas and
in the Philippines. Taking into consideration the three hundred years
of Philippine history, however, it cannot be said that in the actual
operation of the government these precautions were entirely
effective.</p>
<p>According to the laws of the Indies the governor, as executive, had
his own sphere in which the <i lang="es">oidores</i> were forbidden to
interfere.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10178src" href="#xd21e10178"
name="xd21e10178src">86</a> In the light of our investigation, however,
it would appear that this exclusive field was exceedingly limited, and
that even it was continually subject to the encroachments of the
audiencia. In the exercise of his military authority the governor was
independent of the tribunal, although we shall see that on some
occasions the audiencia exercised military jurisdiction in an executive
capacity, and that there were times when the governor was glad to call
upon the audiencia for assistance in this matter. As president of the
audiencia the governor exercised considerable authority during the
first half of the history of the colony, but from 1776 to 1861 his
position as president was merely nominal, and at the latter date it was
abolished. He was the chief administrative official of the colony, and
his authority in this particular was more far-reaching than in any
other. In this, however, he was limited by the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i>
of the audiencia, which developed, as we have seen, from an advisory to
a legislative function, and ultimately had the effect of limiting the
governor in his hitherto exclusive field. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

discussion of this relationship in Smith, <i>The viceroy of New
Spain</i>, 152&ndash;156. Dr. Smith shows that the chief purpose of the
Spanish government in establishing the viceroy and audiencia together
was to guarantee a check and balance of one upon the other. Quoting
Revilla Gigedo (<i lang="es">Instruction</i><span class="corr" id=

presidency of the <i lang="es">audiencia</i> places the viceroy at the
head of that body but not to give orders to it, as even his acts in
matters of justice are subject to it; and although he is present at its
sessions, which is very difficult, considering the grave and continuous
occupations which so vast a command imposes upon him, he does not have
a vote in matters which are regularly dealt with there&mdash;that is,
matters of justice.&rdquo; Dr. Smith shows (162) that the effect of the
later laws of the eighteenth century was to deprive &ldquo;the viceroys
absolutely of any part in the procedure of the administration of
justice, either alone or in company with the other judges, voting with
them in the audiencia&rdquo; (from Revilla Gigedo, <i lang=

the Philippines in legal matters is discussed further on in this

<p class="footnote">Philip III ordered the viceroy of New Spain to
&ldquo;give aid to the governor and captain-general of the Philippines
in whatever may occur, and above all ... to send him on demand whatever
may seem necessary of arms, men, munitions, and money for the
conservation of those Islands, salaries, and <i lang=
"es">presidios</i>, and other matters under his care (<i lang=
"es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>, 3&ndash;4&ndash;13).&rdquo; The viceroys
also exercised a certain degree of authority over the despatch of the
galleons from Acapulco (<i>ibid.</i>, 9&ndash;45&ndash;25 to 31, 47, 74
to 76). Aside from the points indicated, the Philippines were normally
as independent of New Spain as the latter was independent of the
Philippines.</p>

illustrates this statement as follows: &ldquo;The legitimate King of
Borney, who had been dispossessed of his kingdom ... begged for help
from Don Francisco Sande, Governor of these Islands. Governor Sande
went with his fleet, fought with and drove away the tyrant, and put the
legitimate king in possession; the latter rendered obedience to the
governor, appointed in the place of the King of Espa&ntilde;a, and
subjected himself to this crown as vassal and tributary.&rdquo; Further
on he writes, &ldquo;His Majesty also ordered Sande, by a decree of
April 9, 1586, to sustain friendship with China, and forbade him to
make war; for, as some authors say, Sande had the intention of
conquering that Empire, ... although it may be said that the idea was
simply speculative; the Council forbade it, and ordered him thenceforth
to observe what was prescribed&rdquo; (<i>ibid.</i>, see Blair and
Robertson, XVII, 317&ndash;320, whose translation differs slightly from
the above).</p>

Although a sufficient number of <i lang="es">oidores</i> were usually
present in Manila to suffice for the judicial needs of the audiencia,
on many occasions there were only two or three available. When but few
cases were before the tribunal, the junior <i lang="es">oidor</i> could
easily be spared to act as <i lang="es">fiscal</i>. However, when a
magistrate was needed, owing to the multiplicity of cases to be tried,
or the absence of two or more magistrates on special commissions, the
need was very urgent, and the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> was then liable
to be called upon to serve.</p>

Governors, captains-general, and viceroys were assisted by an <i lang=
"es">asesor</i>, or legal adviser, who gave his opinion in all matters
of law that came up for solution. The necessity for this official
developed through the fact that as most governors were soldiers, they
were incapable of rendering judgment on legal and administrative
questions. As counselor to the governor, this official bore the same
relation to the executive as the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> did to the
audiencia. The <i lang="es">asesor</i> was held responsible in the
<i lang="es">residencia</i> for all decisions rendered by the governor
in matters of justice, and in governmental affairs the governor and
<i lang="es">asesor</i> were jointly responsible. Frequently the
<i lang="es">asesor</i> was able to block completely the work of the
audiencia and his opinion nullified the judgments of magistrates who
were as learned in the law and as well qualified, if not better, than
he. Mart&iacute;nez de Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga (<i lang=
"es">Estadismo</i>, I, 224) discusses the influence of the <i lang=
"es">asesor</i> in the following terms: &ldquo;<i lang=
"es">Expedientes</i> are sent to one of the two royal <i lang=
"es">fiscales</i> to ascertain their legality; afterwards they are sent
to the <i lang="es">asesor</i> whom the governors must consult; the
latter place (of <i lang="es">asesor</i>) is a very good one, ...
besides 2000 pesos as salary it has its private revenues in addition to
500 pesos yearly from each of the royal monopolies (discussed in
Chapter V of this volume). There are many persons in Manila who are
exempted from ordinary justice through their military connections or on
account of being employed in the royal monopolies, and as they depend
on him, he exercises great power; ... there are few who desire him for
an enemy, for when they least think of it they are in need of his
favorable opinion in some <i lang="es">expediente</i> which they have
brought before the government.&rdquo; The laws of the Indies forbade
that an <i lang="es">oidor</i> should act as the governor&rsquo;s
<i lang="es">asesor</i> if any other appointee with the requisite
qualifications were available (<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>,
3&ndash;3&ndash;35, and note). See <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> (and
accompanying <i lang="es">expedientes</i>) of September 26, 1756, A.
I., 106&ndash;4&ndash;16.</p>

<i>Ibid.</i>, 3&ndash;3&ndash;60. Relative to the relations of the
viceroys and audiencias of the Spanish colonies, Robertson (<i>The
History of America</i>, IV, 19&ndash;20) says: &ldquo;The Spanish
viceroys have often attempted to intrude themselves into the seat of
justice, and with an ambition which their distance from the controul
(<i>sic</i>) of a superior rendered bold, have aspired at a power which
their master does not venture to assume ... the viceroys have been
prohibited, in the most explicit terms, by repeated laws, from
interfering in the judicial proceedings of the courts of Audience, or
from delivering an opinion, or giving a voice with respect to any point
litigated before them. In some particular cases, in which any question
of civil right is involved, even the political regulations of the
viceroy may be brought under review of the court of Audience, which in
those instances, may be deemed an intermediate power between him and
the people, as a constitutional barrier to circumscribe his
jurisdiction. But as legal restraints on a person who represents the
sovereign, and is clothed with his authority, are little suited to the
genius of Spanish policy; the hesitation and reserve with which it
confers this power on the courts of Audience are remarkable. They may
advise, they <span class="corr" id="xd21e9661" title=
"Source: many">may</span> remonstrate; but in the event of a direct
collision between their opinion and the will of the viceroy, what he
determines must be brought into execution, and nothing remains for
them, but to lay the matter before the king and the Council of the
Indies.&rdquo;</p>

noted that the New Laws of 1542 conferred on the audiencias the duty of
protecting the Indians. Professor Moses, in his <i>Spanish dependencies
in South America</i>, I, (212&ndash;3), says: &ldquo;The audiencias
were commanded to inquire into the treatment which the Indians had
received at the hands of governors and private persons; and, in case of
excesses and ill-treatment, the guilty parties should be punished....
While it was acknowledged that some persons had a sufficient title to
hold Indians, it was ordered that when the number held was excessive,
the audiencia should gather the necessary information and reduce the
allotments made to the said persons in a fair and moderate quantity
&lsquo;and place the rest under the Crown&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

illustration of this in the banishment of Archbishop Poblete by
Governor Salcedo (1663&ndash;1668) as a result of the resistance of the
former to Salcedo&rsquo;s intervention in ecclesiastical matters on the
basis of the royal patronage. Salcedo did not solicit the aid or

&ldquo;Internal political condition of the Philippines,&rdquo; in Blair
and Robertson, LII, 70&ndash;73. Mas was a Spanish diplomatic official
stationed in China, who visited the Islands in 1842 on a semi-official
mission. This writer was not favorably impressed with the effectiveness
of the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i>. He wrote: &ldquo;Whatever difficulty
occurs in the fulfilment of an order, it must be solved by means of a
conference and advice [<i lang="es">consulta</i>], from which a reply
is not obtained until from twelve to fourteen months.&rdquo; Instead of
governmental matters being referred to the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i>,
Mas stated that they were referred to Spain, hence there was great
delay. He stated that the governor scarcely decided any question by
himself, and those which were solved in the colony were referred to the
<i lang="es">asesor</i>, and &ldquo;from this practice,&rdquo; he
continued, &ldquo;arises the system of expedientes, which reigns, and
which is so fatal to the prosperity and good government of the country,
since very often the arrangement that appears good to some, is contrary
to the opinions or interests of others.... Thus much valuable time is
lost and the expedientes result in only a waste of paper, besides great
injury to the islands. The governor often has to conform to the
opinions expressed in the expediente, although he knows they will be
the cause of injustice. On the other hand, the governor is often
directly at fault, because he enforces his own opinion on his assessor
(sp.), who has often obtained his position through favoritism and is
not a lawyer, and decides questions according to the will of the
governor.... The chiefs of the various departments carry on
correspondence with the directors-general of their respective
departments in Madrid, without the knowledge of the governor, a fact
that increases the confusion and disorder.&rdquo; (See also Revilla
Gigedo&rsquo;s description of the evils of the expediente in New Spain
[1790]. Smith, <i>The viceroy of New Spain</i>, 190&ndash;191.)</p>
<p class="footnote">This description of the Philippine government in
1842 would seem to indicate that aside from the limitations imposed
upon his rule by the audiencia, the governor was obliged to contend
with a number of other officials, departments, and regulations, which
effectively prevented him from exercising absolute power, even at the
sacrifice of efficiency. We note in this description, moreover, that
tendency of Spanish colonial government which has been emphasized so
often in this treatise&mdash;namely, the failure of the home government
to leave to the colonial officials sufficient scope of action or
authority to deal adequately with the ordinary problems of government.
Up to the end of the eighteenth century the audiencia was the only
civil authority or tribunal present to exercise any check on the
executive in administrative affairs. However, in the last century the
importance of the audiencia in this regard was diminished by the
creation of other departments, ministries, and offices, by the
elimination of time and space, due to the progress of invention, which
brought the colonies nearer to Spain, and finally by the fact that the
tribunal itself was more and more confined to judicial affairs.</p>

Blair and Robertson, LII, 69&ndash;70 and note. The keen observations
of this official on social and governmental conditions in the
Philippines are peculiarly pertinent, and they are as true in many
regards today as they were seventy-five years ago. He recommended a
regency to govern the Philippines, consisting of the governor as
president, a military commander and an intendant of finance. The
audiencia, according to his plan of reform, was to be limited to
judicial affairs, with appellate jurisdiction over civil, criminal, and
commercial cases. Instead of the audiencia as a court of appeals
against the governor, the regency was to entertain appeals from the
audiencia. Many of his ideas were incorporated into the new laws of the
last half of the nineteenth century (<i>ibid.</i>, 78&ndash;85).</p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE AUDIENCIA AND THE GOVERNOR: THE MILITARY
JURISDICTION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The isolation of the Philippines, their distance from
the home country and New Spain, and their proximity to the colonies and
trade routes of rival nations, made the problem of defense the foremost
consideration. This was almost equally true of New Spain, Per&uacute;,
and the West Indian colonies, all of which were exposed to the attack
of outside enemies, though, of course, they were neither as isolated
nor as far away as the Philippines.</p>
<p>The necessity of being ever on the alert, constantly prepared to
resist invasion and to put down insurrection, gave a military character
to the governments of these colonies. The viceroys and governors were
in most cases trained soldiers. In addition to their other
prerogatives, they exercised the office and title of captain-general
and as such they commanded the military and naval forces of their
colonies, inadequate as these forces sometimes were. During the first
two hundred years governors and viceroys were largely selected on the
basis of their past military exploits on the continent or in America.
The administrations of the different Philippine governors of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were characterized rather by their
devotion to military affairs than by economic improvements or
administrative efficiency. The supervision of judicial and governmental
affairs was thus left for long periods in the hands of other officials
and authorities, to be reclaimed or fought over by the governors when
their time was not taken up by military conquests.</p>
<p>It is practically agreed among all authorities who have written
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>on the Philippines that the leading
consideration and necessity of the government during two hundred years
was military defense. These writers comprise officials who saw service
there and commentators who visited the Islands and studied the
government. In their recommendations and comments they unite in urging
that the defense of the Islands should not be neglected; that the
governor should be given adequate forces with sufficient jurisdiction
over them and over the other elements of the colony to defend it
successfully from invasion or insurrection.</p>
<p>It was the policy of the government throughout the history of the
Islands to conserve and keep intact the governor&rsquo;s military
jurisdiction. We have noted in an earlier chapter that one of the main
reasons for the suppression of the audiencia in 1589 was that it
interfered too extensively with the military jurisdiction of the
governor. During the decade following the extinction of the tribunal,
the military governors were given almost unlimited powers, until their
abuses led to the re-establishment of the tribunal to guard against
these excesses. We shall see in the following chapter that the
limitations placed upon them by the audiencia were always a source of
complaint by the various governors. Governor Acu&ntilde;a went so far
as to recommend the suppression of the tribunal because the needs of
the colony were military and had to be met by the firm action of a
soldier, without the interference of a body of magistrates.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10202src" href="#xd21e10202" name=
"xd21e10202src">1</a> Similar recommendations were made by a majority
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>the succeeding governors, but more especially by
Fajardo, Corcuera, Vargas, Arand&iacute;a, and even by Anda who had
risen from the post of <i lang="es">oidor</i> to that of governor and
military commander.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10218src" href=
"#xd21e10218" name="xd21e10218src">2</a></p>
<p>The conviction that the government should be pre-eminently military
was not held by governors alone. Fernando de los R&iacute;os Coronel,
procurator of the Philippines at the Court of Madrid in 1597, urged
that the government should be of a military character and that the
practice of sending soldiers to govern the Islands should be
continued.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10223src" href="#xd21e10223"
name="xd21e10223src">3</a> This opinion was also advanced by Fray
Alonso S&aacute;nchez, procurator of the Islands at Madrid in 1589, and
the emissary whose arguments were chiefly instrumental in bringing
about the suppression of the audiencia.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10226src" href="#xd21e10226" name="xd21e10226src">4</a> Francisco
Leandro de Viana, the most efficient <i lang="es">fiscal</i> that the
Islands ever had, and afterwards councillor of the Indies, recognized
the military attributes of the governor&rsquo;s position. He urged a
separation of the spheres of the governor and the audiencia,
recommending that the former should attend solely to war and
government, while the latter should confine itself to matters of
justice.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10232src" href="#xd21e10232" name=
"xd21e10232src">5</a></p>
<p>This opinion was shared by Juan Jos&eacute; Delgado, the able Jesuit
historian, who expressed the conviction that the &ldquo;islands need
disinterested military governors, not merchants; and men of resolution
and character, not students, who are more fit to govern monasteries
than communities of heroes.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10237src"
href="#xd21e10237" name="xd21e10237src">6</a> Delgado recommended that
governors of the Philippines should be picked <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span>men,
selected for their military qualities. The distance and isolation of
the colony and its proximity to the great empires of China and Japan
made defense the first requisite. Delgado believed that a soldier would
be less amenable to bribes and that commercial ventures would be less
attractive to him.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10242src" href=
"#xd21e10242" name="xd21e10242src">7</a> He recommended that governors
should be absolute in affairs of government and war and that all
departments and officials of the government should be subject to
him.</p>
<p>While most of the independent commentators writing on the subject
seem to have conceived of the duties of the governor as savoring more
of war than of peace, we may note that Manuel Bern&aacute;ldez Pizarro,
for many years a resident and official in the Philippines, writing in
1827, urged that the governors there should be efficient administrators
rather than soldiers. It must be remembered, however, that the
political conditions in the Philippines during his period were widely
different from those of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries when
the Islands were constantly exposed to the attack of outside enemies
and liable to insurrections within. The chief problems of the
nineteenth century were administrative, rather than military. He
pointed out that governors had already exhibited too much of the
militant spirit in dealing with the problems of government, &ldquo;not
heeding the opinions and customs of the country, but depending on the
force of arms,&rdquo; or their <i lang="es">asesores</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10253src" href="#xd21e10253" name=
"xd21e10253src">8</a> This had the effect of causing dissensions
between the governor and audiencia, and the resultant discord had
furnished a very bad example for the natives and residents of the
colony.</p>
<p>The characteristic tendency throughout the history, of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>Islands to lay stress on the military side of
the governor&rsquo;s position was commented on by Montero y Vidal, the
modern historian of the Philippines, in the following terms:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The authority of the governor-general is complete, and
so great a number of attributes conferred on one functionary,
incompetent, as a general rule, for everything outside of military
affairs, is certainly prejudicial to the right exercise of his duty;
... since 1822 the government has always devolved upon an official; a
general, and in the case of his death, a <i lang="es">segundo cabo</i>,
and, in case of the death of the latter, a commandant of the naval
station.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10266src" href="#xd21e10266" name=
"xd21e10266src">9</a></p>
</div>
<p>The preservation of the peace and the maintenance of the defense of
the Islands was the chief responsibility and the most important duty of
the governor and captain-general. Although the audiencia was ordered to
do all that it could to assist, nevertheless the tribunal was strictly
forbidden to restrict or hinder the governor in the execution of his
military duties.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10277src" href=
"#xd21e10277" name="xd21e10277src">10</a> The governor&rsquo;s position
as commander-in-chief of the king&rsquo;s forces, and his pre-eminence
in military affairs, were generally recognized.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the early laws conferred exclusive
military powers on the governor, a glance at three hundred years of
Spanish colonial history will show that the audiencias participated in
these matters in two different ways. In fact, an analysis of the
military jurisdiction shows the presence and the exercise, in general,
of two kinds of activity. These consisted, first, of a special judicial
system for the trial of persons under military law and distinct from
the civil jurisdiction, and second, of the control and disposition of
the military forces of the Islands, and their utilization for defense.
One, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>therefore, was judicial, the other was
administrative, but both of these forces of activity were within the
military sphere. The problem of this chapter, therefore, consists in
determining the conditions, circumstances, and extent of the
audiencia&rsquo;s participation in military affairs, and of its
relation to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor and
captain-general.</p>
<p>As commander-in-chief, the governor was at the head of a special
judicial system for the trial of soldiers under the military law. This
judicial system was independent of the audiencia, and the latter body,
during the greater part of the history of the Islands, was denied
jurisdiction in these cases, even on appeal.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10289src" href="#xd21e10289" name="xd21e10289src">11</a> We have
already noted, however, the tendency of the law to excuse these busy
executives from direct participation in ordinary judicial activities.
Notwithstanding the governor&rsquo;s status in the above-mentioned
particular, he seldom intervened personally in the trial of such cases.
His position with regard to the military jurisdiction was similar to
his relation with the audiencia, of which he was president, but over
which he seldom presided.</p>
<p>The actual trial of the criminal cases of soldiers was conducted in
first instance by military tribunals and magistrates. Most prominent
among the latter were the <i lang="es">castell&aacute;n</i> and the
<i lang="es">maestre de campo</i>. The captains, themselves, had
certain judicial authority within their companies.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e10302src" href="#xd21e10302" name="xd21e10302src">12</a>
Appeals were made from these military judges of first instance to the
captain-general. If there had been notorious injustice or a grave
infraction of the law in the trial of a case of first instance, it was
the governor&rsquo;s duty either to refer the case to some other
magistrate than to the one who originally tried it, or to a special
judicial tribunal. An <i lang="es">oidor</i> might be designated to
serve in this tribunal. When the magistrates served in this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>capacity they were responsible entirely to the
governor and were not identified with the audiencia. <i lang=
"es">Oidores</i> frequently objected to this service, but the governor
was usually able to enforce these demands, which were in accordance
with the laws and approved by the home government.</p>
<p>The captain-general exercised the pardoning power. Under some
circumstances cases might be appealed to Spain, but in these suits,
most of which involved personal crimes and misdemeanors, the decision
of the captain-general or the local military tribunal was usually
final, if for no other reason than the fact that the soldiers in Manila
lacked the means to carry their cases further. Those cases which were
appealed usually involved principles of law desirable to be tested by
reference to a higher tribunal. The <i lang="es">junta de guerra de
Indias</i> received all appeals from the military officials of the
colonies and solved all questions of a judicial or administrative
character that were carried to it.</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">junta de guerra</i> consisted of four ministers of
the Supreme Council of War who were designated to sit with an equal
number of ministers of the Council of the Indies.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10326src" href="#xd21e10326" name="xd21e10326src">13</a> It was,
in fact, the executive committee and at the same time the special
tribunal of military affairs for the Council of the Indies. It passed
upon such military questions as were nominally referred to it by the
president of the Council of the Indies, although these cases
automatically came to this <i lang="es">junta</i> without the
intervention of the president of the Council. It had jurisdiction over
appeals in cases affecting soldiers tried in first or second instance
in the colonies, over the administrative matters of armament and
defense: the equipment of fleets and military operations, garrisons,
military supplies, and munitions. It also tried appeals from the
tribunal of the <i lang="es">Casa de Contrataci&oacute;n</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>and, in fact, it exercised general supervision
over that institution in its various activities.</p>
<p>This was the machinery which existed for the adjudication of
military cases during the greater part of the history of the Islands,
the magistrates of the audiencia officiating as <i lang="es">auditores
de guerra</i> when designated by the governor.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10347src" href="#xd21e10347" name="xd21e10347src">14</a> The
royal decree of January 30, 1855, made a radical reform in this
particular, adding two new magistrates, an <i lang="es">auditor de
guerra</i> and an <i lang="es">auditor de marina</i> and to some extent
relieving the ministers of the audiencia. These magistrates were
appointed by the Minister of War and had original and secondary
jurisdiction over cases involving soldiers and sailors of the fleet.
These new magistrates served as ministers of the audiencia when their
special duties permitted, and they were ordered to consult with the
governor from time to time in regard to matters pertaining to their
respective fields. Though the audiencia was forbidden to concern itself
with cases which belonged to the military jurisdiction, the regent and
two magistrates of the tribunal, acting with the <i lang="es">auditor
de guerra</i> or the <i lang="es">auditor de marina</i>, could resolve
themselves into a special court for the trial in second instance of
cases pertaining to the respective fields of the last two
officials.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10371src" href="#xd21e10371"
name="xd21e10371src">15</a></p>
<p>Two or three cases may be described here which illustrate the method
of procedure in the trial of military cases by the tribunals. On
January 22, 1787, a royal order was issued on the recommendation of the
<i lang="es">junta de guerra de Indias</i>, approving of a sentence of
death pronounced upon a soldier in the Philippines four years before.
This soldier had been sentenced in first instance by the <i lang=
"es">castell&aacute;n</i>. The captain-general, on appeal, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>affirmed the sentence, and the <i lang=
"es">junta de guerra</i> approved the proceedings when the case was
appealed a second time.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10390src" href=
"#xd21e10390" name="xd21e10390src">16</a> Another case, and one which
illustrates the slowness of the proceedings of this <i lang=
"es">junta</i>, as well as the nature of its jurisdiction, was that of
a soldier who had set fire to a powder magazine, causing it to explode,
thereby killing several persons. The culprit was sentenced by the
<i lang="es">consejo ordinario de guerra</i>, a sort of local military
and strategic committee, composed of local military officers (in this
case a kind of court-martial),<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10400src"
href="#xd21e10400" name="xd21e10400src">17</a> but Governor Basco y
Vargas, upon the advice of his <i lang="es">asesor</i>, suspended
sentence, directing the case to the <i lang="es">junta de guerra</i>.
Nothing was done, however, and on December 10, 1788, Governor Marquina,
successor to Basco y Vargas, wrote to the president of the Council of
the Indies, calling attention to the fact that this soldier had been in
prison for six years awaiting the action of the Council of the
Indies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10424src" href="#xd21e10424" name=
"xd21e10424src">18</a> The matter was then referred to the <i lang=
"es">junta</i> and the sentence was approved by that tribunal.</p>
<p>As in all other departments and activities of government, so in
this, there were many opportunities for conflict between the audiencia
and the governor as to authority over cases which by their nature
bordered on the sphere of both the civil <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>and military
jurisdictions. The governor who had the power to assign cases to
whatever tribunal he chose, often took advantage of his position to
bring the trial of civil cases within his own military sphere. Among
these were suits involving the militiamen. These were subject to the
military jurisdiction when they were under arms, and at other times,
being civilians, they were subject to the civil authorities.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10441src" href="#xd21e10441" name=
"xd21e10441src">19</a> An instance of a case of this kind occurred in
1800. A militiaman, Josef Ruy, had killed an Indian, and the audiencia,
on the basis of its authority over Indians, had sentenced the culprit
to death. The governor, after sentence was passed, reopened the case on
the ground that as a member of the militia, Ruy was subject to the
military and not to the civil jurisdiction, although the militia was
not at that time in active service. The judgment of the audiencia was
therefore suspended. The case, meanwhile, had been appealed to the
Council of the Indies, and that tribunal had approved the sentence of
the audiencia, apparently without taking note of the fact that the case
involved the military jurisdiction. A short time afterward the Council
received a second report from the audiencia, stating that jurisdiction
over the case had been surrendered to the governor on account of its
military character. This procedure was accordingly approved by the
Council. Soon after, report came of the receipt by the audiencia of the
former judgment of the Council, relative to the action first taken by
the audiencia, with the information that since the will of the Council
was known, the governor had surrendered the prisoner again to the
jurisdiction of the audiencia. Disgusted at the contradiction and
cross-purposes at which the authorities in the Islands were working,
the king decreed on March 27, 1802, that cases involving Indians should
be tried in the audiencia, but that this poor wretch had been tried and
retried, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>condemned and condemned over again so often that
he had already expatiated his crime. He was accordingly authorized to
go free.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10446src" href="#xd21e10446" name=
"xd21e10446src">20</a></p>
<p>The king administered a severe reprimand to the governor and
<i lang="es">oidores</i> on this occasion for their insistence on these
small points of personal dignity in which the real purpose of the law
was entirely overlooked in the pompous insistence of these officials on
what they imagined to be their own particular rights. The case just
alluded to began in 1792, and was carried through ten years of petty
strife. The blame for this cannot be ascribed entirely to the
magistrates of the audiencia, or to the governor, who had to act in
accordance with the law as he interpreted it. The real fault lay in the
failure of the Spanish governmental system to place implicit confidence
in the judgment and ability of its servants. Considering the final ends
of justice, it made little difference whether sentence was pronounced
upon this individual by the governor as military commander, or as
president of the audiencia. It is true that the authorities might have
compromised on many occasions; indeed, from the viewpoint of history it
may be said that they should have done so, instead of so often wasting
their energies on these petty battles. These incessant disputes were
encouraged and facilitated by the ease with which appeals could be made
to Spain, thus hindering the immediate execution of decisions. The
Council of the Indies interfered in details which should have been left
entirely to the colonial authorities. This interference encouraged
appeal, and matters of no relative importance to Spain&rsquo;s colonial
empire frequently occupied a large share of the attention of the
sovereign tribunal. Colonial officials were not entrusted with the
authority and responsibility which they should have had, and the
central government <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237"
name="pb237">237</a>]</span>wasted its time attending to small affairs
which should have been concluded by subordinates in the colonies.</p>
<p>The governor frequently claimed jurisdiction over cases involving
retired soldiers on the grounds that they had once been under the
<i lang="es">fuero militar</i>. He also claimed jurisdiction in suits
affecting widows of soldiers, all of which, in accordance with the law
of December 11, 1788, should have been tried by the audiencia.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10461src" href="#xd21e10461" name=
"xd21e10461src">21</a> Another abuse frequently perpetrated by the
governor was the assumption of jurisdiction over suits for the payment
by military officials of bonds which they had assumed for defaulted
civil officials.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10464src" href=
"#xd21e10464" name="xd21e10464src">22</a> In doing this he was
encroaching on the rights of the <i lang="es">oficiales reales</i>, and
these were always supported by the audiencia in the contentions which
arose over this question. Cases involving conflicts of jurisdiction
between the civil and military authorities were appealed to the Council
of the Indies, and there, after considerable delay, the proper sphere
of authority was always determined.</p>
<p>While the audiencia as a tribunal was forbidden jurisdiction in the
trial of cases involving war, we have already shown that the governor
exercised the right of designating <i lang="es">oidores</i> to try
cases of this nature on second appeal. The power of enforcing this
right depended entirely on the governor. Frequently the efforts of the
governor along these lines were attended with much difficulty as were
those of Governor Marquina in 1789 when he sought to designate an
<i lang="es">oidor</i> to assist in the trial of Antonio Callejo, naval
artilleryman on a frigate of war. The case had first been tried before
the proper military judge, but it was referred on appeal to a tribunal
of which an <i lang="es">alcalde ordinario</i> of the city was a
member. The governor designated Oidor Yuguanzo to act as a member of
this tribunal for the trial of the case of Callejo on review. The
magistrate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>begged to be excused on the ground that all his
time was occupied with the trial of civil cases in the audiencia. The
governor called on all the other <i lang="es">oidores</i> successively,
and all declined to act. At last he peremptorily ordered Yuguanzo to
serve, telling him that if he objected he might carry the matter to the
king in the regular way, which, according to the laws of the Indies,
was to comply with the governor&rsquo;s demands, under protest, while
appealing the question of disagreement to the Council of the
Indies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10487src" href="#xd21e10487" name=
"xd21e10487src">23</a> This was accordingly done, the magistrate basing
his claim to exemption on the law which prohibited the governor from
sending <i lang="es">oidores</i> on commissions outside the
audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10495src" href="#xd21e10495"
name="xd21e10495src">24</a> The governor at the same time filed a
memorial which forestalled all the arguments of the <i lang=
"es">oidor</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10503src" href="#xd21e10503"
name="xd21e10503src">25</a> He stated that the real cause of the
disinclination of the magistrates of the audiencia to serve as <i lang=
"es">auditores de guerra</i> was their indolence, and not the pressure
of their excessive duties. It was contrary to their ideas of dignity to
be associated with the acting <i lang="es">auditor de guerra</i>, who
was not a <i lang="es">letrado</i>, and it was therefore considered a
sacrifice of their own personal dignity. The governor stated that no
argument could justify such an attitude on the part of the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i>. The inconsistency of their position was further
shown, he alleged, by the fact that they had served regularly on the
tribunal of appeals of the <i lang="es">consulado</i>, in company with
two merchants who were not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href=
"#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>even lawyers. Hence there could be
no reason for their refusal to serve with an <i lang="es">alcalde
ordinario</i>.</p>
<p>The governor based his right to call upon the regular magistrates
for this service on that section of the laws of the Indies applying to
Espa&ntilde;ola, Nuevo Reino, and Tierra Firme, which declared that
jurisdiction over cases affecting soldiers belonged to the
captain-general with inhibition of the audiencia, and that soldiers,
during the time they were under arms, should not be tried on criminal
charges.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10542src" href="#xd21e10542" name=
"xd21e10542src">26</a> The governor, according to this law, might call
upon a magistrate to serve as special <i lang="es">auditor de
guerra</i> for the determination of cases in second instance. Finally,
by April 20, 1784, the king had extended this rule to all other
colonies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10550src" href="#xd21e10550" name=
"xd21e10550src">27</a> Although we have no record of the reply of the
tribunal in Spain, the strength of the governor&rsquo;s position could
not well be questioned, especially since he was resting his case on a
law made in 1784, which was completely up-to-date, while the
magistrate&rsquo;s contention was based on one promulgated in
1609.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10555src" href="#xd21e10555" name=
"xd21e10555src">28</a></p>
<p>Aside from the duty of the <i lang="es">oidores</i> to try military
cases when commissioned by the governor to do so, it will be seen that
the tribunal itself exercised much more extensive authority in the
actual administration of military affairs. Two factors may be said to
have contributed to this. One was the fact that the audiencia was
frequently consulted by the king or governor in regard to the defense
of the colony. The other may be seen in the actual assumption of the
government at various times by the audiencia, and the successful
defense of the Islands by the military forces under the leadership of
the <i lang="es">oidores</i>. Notwithstanding the fact that the
governor&rsquo;s recognized sphere of action was military, and in spite
of the repeated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240"
name="pb240">240</a>]</span>prohibitions against the interference of
the tribunal in these matters, the audiencia received considerable
official encouragement and authorization to interest itself in military
affairs.</p>
<p>As the problems of general administration were too serious for the
solution of one man without advisors, so the governor also found it
frequently undesirable to assume sole responsibility for military
affairs. The audiencia shared the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> power in
these matters to a lesser degree than it did in government. The
hostility of the Japanese in the early years, the fear of the Chinese,
the danger of native outbreaks, the raids of the Moro pirates, and the
incursions of the Portuguese, Dutch, and English aroused the fears of
the commonwealth to such an extent that defense was felt to be a matter
of common concern. The governor, upon whom legally rested the
obligations and responsibilities of defense, was glad to share these
duties with any authority that could be of assistance. The history of
the Philippines is replete with instances in which the audiencia either
gave counsel in matters pertaining to defense, or took an active part
in resistance. There were even occasions on which it advocated
offensive warfare.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10585src" href=
"#xd21e10585" name="xd21e10585src">29</a></p>
<p>We have seen in an earlier chapter that the audiencia manifested a
keen interest in military affairs immediately upon its establishment.
In the chapter on the establishment of the tribunal we noted the
memorials of individual <i lang="es">oidores</i> and of the audiencia
as a tribunal, advising the governor and the king as to the necessity
of conquering the Moros, and on the best way of putting down
insurrections in the Islands. The question of defense against the
Portuguese and the Dutch was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href=
"#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>also discussed in the letters of
the <i lang="es">oidores</i>. In some cases their advice was
considered, on other occasions the governor complained against them for
exceeding their jurisdiction. One of the most noteworthy instances of
the recognized intervention of the <i lang="es">oidores</i> in military
matters was on April 19, 1586, when a council, called together by
Governor Sande and consisting of the governor, the bishop, and the
<i lang="es">oidores</i>, considered the immediate occupation of China.
This was urged by Governor Sande, but he was overruled by the moderate
counsels of the bishop and magistrates.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10608src" href="#xd21e10608" name="xd21e10608src">30</a></p>
<p>No better illustration of the willingness of the governor to share
his military responsibilities can be given than the reliance of
Governor Dasmari&ntilde;as on the religious authorities for advice in
military affairs, after the suppression of the audiencia in
1589.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10616src" href="#xd21e10616" name=
"xd21e10616src">31</a> He consulted with them on ways and means of
defending the colony against the Japanese, whose threatening attitude
during his administration rendered precarious the continuance of
Spanish power in the Islands. On one occasion he consulted the
religious orders as to the advisability of expelling all Japanese and
Chinese traders from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242"
name="pb242">242</a>]</span>Manila. The accumulation of provisions
against a possible siege, the seizure of the persons and property of
all Japanese residents, the establishment of a place of refuge for
women, children, and sick persons in case of invasion, and the
appropriation of the property of the natives as a pledge of their good
behavior in the event of hostilities, were measures proposed by the
governor to the religious for their consideration. Dasmari&ntilde;as,
on another occasion, asked the advice of the Augustinians, Dominicans,
and Jesuits as to the best manner of dealing with an insurrection in
Zambales, and the religious authorities, after quoting scholars,
saints, and theologians, made lengthy recommendations.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10624src" href="#xd21e10624" name=
"xd21e10624src">32</a> These facts make clear the unwillingness of this
governor to take the initiative in affairs pertaining to his own
special province. He was content to ask and receive the advice of
priests, monks, and magistrates, on military affairs. He was willing to
seek the counsel of any and all available persons or authorities who
could or would advise him. It is, of course, clear that the audiencia,
when in existence, would be preferred as a source of advice and counsel
to a community of religious.</p>
<p>Not only did the governor set a precedent of seeking the advice of
the audiencia during this early period, but the king often sought the
opinion of the magistrates in regard to military affairs. Various
matters were referred by the sovereign to the <i lang="es">oidores</i>
at different times: questions involving the building of walls and
fortifications of Manila, and the number and size of cannon needed for
the proper equipment of the latter; the audiencia was asked whether it
would be better to bring gunpowder from New Spain or to manufacture it
in the Islands; the magistrates were required on several occasions to
furnish information as to the number of men needed for the defense of
the Islands, and whether the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href=
"#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>natives would make good soldiers.
The audiencia furnished information to the king concerning the
availability of the various Philippine woods for shipbuilding, and it
furnished estimates as to the probable cost of ships both for commerce
and war.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10634src" href="#xd21e10634" name=
"xd21e10634src">33</a> All these matters were supposed to come within
the special military jurisdiction of the governor, yet, not only that
official, but the king himself, required the advice of the magistrates
on these questions.</p>
<p>The conquest of Mindanao and the war in the Moluccas were also
subjects of correspondence between the court and the local
audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10639src" href="#xd21e10639"
name="xd21e10639src">34</a> The king, on various occasions, requested
information of the <i lang="es">oidores</i> concerning the natives and
their attitude towards law and order, whether the various tribes were
quiet, by nature peaceful or warlike, and what measures, in the
opinions of the magistrates, would be best in dealing with them. The
audiencia was consulted on other occasions as to the best manner of
fortifying the Visayan Islands against the attacks of the Moros, and
northern Luz&oacute;n against the Chinese and Japanese, the possible
cost and most suitable locations of fortifications, and their
availability and probable value in repelling invasions.</p>
<p>The reliance of the governor and the court upon the magistrates of
the audiencia for advice in the matter of defense was not
characteristic only of the early years of Philippine history. In 1744
Governor Torre submitted his scheme for the fortification of the city
of Manila to the audiencia before he sent it to the king for final
approval.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10647src" href="#xd21e10647" name=
"xd21e10647src">35</a> Torre was aided by a regular council of war
(<i lang="es">consejo de guerra</i>) of which the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> were members and he submitted questions relative to
the defense of the Islands to this council. In 1746, this local council
of war <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>reported on the advisability and feasibility of
manufacturing guns and powder in the colony.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10658src" href="#xd21e10658" name="xd21e10658src">36</a> Governor
Obando, writing in 1748 to the king, and commenting on the relationship
of the previous governor with the audiencia in the matter of defense,
divided between his predecessor and the audiencia the responsibility
for the payment of ten thousand pesos to bribe the Dutch to keep away
from the city, and not to reduce it.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10662src" href="#xd21e10662" name="xd21e10662src">37</a> In a
subsequent chapter we shall discuss the important part played by the
audiencia in the defense and surrender of the Islands to the British in
1762. These incidents, taken at random from various governors&rsquo;
administrations, show that the audiencia was required to do all that it
could to assist the governor and captain-general in the defense of the
colony. It was also called upon to advise the court on military
affairs; thus it was frequently able to assist in formulating and
guiding the policies of the home government with regard to defense and
military administration. In this way an indirect, but distinct check
was placed upon the governor in his own field, and an incapable or
radical executive was thus prevented from endangering the peace and
security of the colony.</p>
<p>But the influence of the audiencia operated much more effectively in
defense of the colony than through the advice which it rendered either
to the king or to the governor. From 1601 to 1625, during which period
the residents of the colony were continually alarmed by the unceasing
encroachments of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245"
name="pb245">245</a>]</span>the Dutch, the audiencia was frequently
obliged to assume responsibility for the defense of the colony. In 1600
and 1601, when Francisco Tello de Guzm&aacute;n was governor, Antonio
de Morga, the senior <i lang="es">oidor</i>, led an expedition against
the Dutch pirate Van Noordt and defeated him in Manila Bay. In 1607,
the audiencia, then in charge of the government, maintained the defense
of Manila and Cavite against the Dutch.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10672src" href="#xd21e10672" name="xd21e10672src">38</a> While
Governor Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a was absent in the Moluccas in
1605&ndash;1606 on a campaign of conquest, the audiencia entertained
and responded to a petition from the king of Tidore for assistance in
resisting the oppression of the king of Ternate. The war in the
Moluccas was continued by the interim government of the audiencia
(1606&ndash;1608).</p>
<p>The audiencia repeatedly assumed charge of the government during the
frequent absences of Governor Juan de Silva (1609&ndash;1616) on
expeditions of conquest; and it governed two years after his death
(1616&ndash;1618). Under the leadership of Oidor Andr&eacute;s de
Alcaraz the military and naval forces of the Islands repeatedly
repelled the invasions of the Dutch.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10677src" href="#xd21e10677" name="xd21e10677src">39</a> Of
special merit was the work of this <i lang="es">oidor</i> in the
preparation and equipment of a fleet of seven galleons which he led in
the battle of Playa Honda, on April 14, 1617. In order to raise money
with which to meet the expenses of this campaign, the audiencia was
compelled to resort to the extraordinary recourse of seizing the money
of Manila merchants on its arrival from Acapulco on the galleon. It
also forced loans from residents and officials who were in the colony.
The audiencia authorized the sale and the payment in advance for space
on the galleon of the coming year. Alcaraz, in a report to the king,
stated that the <i lang="es">oidores</i> had labored with diligence for
the defense of the colony, personally concerning themselves with the
casting of artillery, the drilling of soldiers, the obtaining of
supplies, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>in otherwise preparing the city for more
adequate defense.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10691src" href=
"#xd21e10691" name="xd21e10691src">40</a></p>
<p>Under the leadership of the able soldiers and captains-general, Juan
Ni&ntilde;o de Tavora (1626&ndash;1632), Sebasti&aacute;n Hurtado de
Corcuera (1634&ndash;1635), and Diego Fajardo (1644&ndash;1653), the
audiencia interfered but little with the notable military operations of
that period. Exception to this statement must be made in the cases of
the capture and relinquishment of the island of Formosa in 1629 and
1642, respectively. The audiencia was unreservedly opposed to the
proposed conquest of the island by Governor Tavora, who, nevertheless,
undertook the expedition and carried it to a successful conclusion.
When Governor Corcuera decided that the position of the Spaniards in
Formosa was untenable and resolved to withdraw the garrison, the
audiencia was equally forceful in its remonstrances. It sent charges to
the court against the governor, alleging that this loss, and that of
the Moluccas the year before would assuredly lead to the greater
disaster of the loss of the Philippines.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The important part played by the audiencia in the defense of Manila
against the British in 1762 will be discussed in another chapter. While
Governor Rojo and the majority of the <i lang="es">oidores</i> were in
the city, surrounded by the enemy, Oidor Anda y Salazar, who had been
sent to the provinces as visitor, organized and maintained a defense
against the enemy. When he was commanded by the governor to surrender,
he refused, successfully maintaining the claim that as the sole,
legally-appointed <i lang="es">oidor</i> who had not surrendered, he
was both audiencia and governor, and as such his actions were legal.
His <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>claims were recognized and approved by the king.
This is perhaps the most peculiar and extraordinary example of the
audiencia&rsquo;s assumption of military power.</p>
<p>The frequent assumption of the government by the audiencia, with
responsibility for matters of defense and military administration may
be cited as an additional reason for its reluctance to entirely abandon
its interest in these affairs on the arrival of a governor.
Notwithstanding this, and the additional fact that the king and
governor frequently consulted the audiencia on military affairs, the
tribunal did not always seek to retain pre&euml;minence in military
affairs. This fact is shown by a letter which the audiencia wrote in
1598, acknowledging that &ldquo;the only cases in which the governor is
entitled to entire jurisdiction are those over soldiers&mdash;and these
cases he may try independently, since he is
captain-general.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10715src" href=
"#xd21e10715" name="xd21e10715src">42</a> There were numerous other
occasions on which the audiencia unreservedly recognized the
jurisdiction of the governor, often protesting against his excesses in
military matters, but going no further than to register its
protestations. For instance, it charged Governor Fajardo with
carelessness in the outfitting of ships to resist the Dutch. One ship,
it was said, was so poorly equipped that it sank before it left port.
Fajardo was moreover accused of removing the commander of one of these
ships, substituting his fifteen-year-old brother, Lu&iacute;s Fajardo,
at a salary of 40,000 pesos. The audiencia contented itself with
remonstrances against these wrongs, but it made no attempt to
interfere.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10718src" href="#xd21e10718"
name="xd21e10718src">43</a> Fajardo had his way in these matters, but
he would have been compelled to answer for them personally in his
<i lang="es">residencia</i> had he not died before that investigation
took place.</p>
<p>The governor&rsquo;s accountability for the government of the
Chinese was closely related to his jurisdiction over military
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>affairs. The Chinese were regarded with great
suspicion by the residents of Manila, who lived in constant fear of an
outbreak in the Pari&aacute;n, or of a descent upon the coast of
Luz&oacute;n by Chinese from without. The problem of the Chinese was
therefore essentially one of defense, and as such it was entrusted to
the governor and captain-general. Nevertheless, the audiencia claimed
the right to intervene in many matters pertaining to the government of
these people, and there was much dissension between the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> and the governor over this question. The governor on
some occasions rigidly resisted the claims of the audiencia to exercise
jurisdiction over the Chinese, and on others he invited the
participation of the tribunal. This state of affairs was brought about
by the seeming conflict of the laws bearing upon this question.</p>
<p>The earliest legislation to be found in the laws of the Indies
dealing with the government of the Chinese was enacted on April 15,
1603.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10733src" href="#xd21e10733" name=
"xd21e10733src">44</a> This law forbade the <i lang="es">alcaldes
ordinarios</i> to exercise jurisdiction over suits of the Chinese in
the Pari&aacute;n, but it ordered that all cases involving them should
be tried by a special <i lang="es">alcalde</i> of the Pari&aacute;n
with right of appeal to the audiencia. A special judge was thus created
by this law, with jurisdiction over the Chinese.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10744src" href="#xd21e10744" name="xd21e10744src">45</a> The
purpose of this enactment was to establish a system of judicial
procedure for the Chinese, whereby the latter might be kept apart from
the Spaniards and natives in judicial as well as in governmental
administration. This necessity was partly based on economic
considerations, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249"
name="pb249">249</a>]</span>and partly on racial and religious reasons;
it was designed essentially for the protection of the
Spaniards.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10758src" href="#xd21e10758"
name="xd21e10758src">46</a></p>
<p>On the basis of the above law of April 15, 1603, the audiencia
immediately proceeded to concern itself with the government of the
Chinese. It claimed jurisdiction particularly over the right to issue
licenses allowing Chinese to reside and trade in the Philippines. This
authority was also claimed by the governor and captain-general, who was
responsible for the defense of the Islands. The audiencia also
proceeded to issue regulations for the Chinese trade, laying itself
open to the charge of selfish interest in these commercial activities.
Complaints against the audiencia&rsquo;s intervention reaching the
court, new regulations were issued on November 4 and December 1, 1606,
which forbade the audiencia to concern itself with anything relative to
the government and administration of the Pari&aacute;n, or with the
Chinese who might come to the Islands for the purpose of trade, except
at the solicitation of the governor.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10763src" href="#xd21e10763" name="xd21e10763src">47</a> In the
letter accompanying these orders, the king informed Governor
Acu&ntilde;a that although the Chinese in the Pari&aacute;n were under
his charge, he was to take no important steps for their government
without first consulting the audiencia. The inference of this law is
clear, therefore, that the audiencia might have other activities than
the purely judicial. This implication gave rise later to a considerable
difference of opinion, but in consequence of this law the governor was
established as the fountain of authority in Chinese affairs, with the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> in a secondary position. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span></p>
<p>On June 12, 1614, Philip III re-enacted the above law with some
modifications. The <i lang="es">fiscal</i> was made legal protector of
the Chinese. He was ordered to advise the <i lang="es">alcalde</i> of
the Pari&aacute;n in legal matters pertaining to them, and the <i lang=
"es">alcalde</i> was to take no important steps without the advice and
assistance of the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10786src" href="#xd21e10786" name="xd21e10786src">48</a> The
governor was ordered not to allow any ordinary or special judge,
<i lang="es">alcalde del crimen</i>, or <i lang="es">oidor</i>, to
exercise jurisdiction in first instance over civil suits or criminal
cases of the Chinese, or to make inspections in the Pari&aacute;n. The
last clause of this law, however, qualified and rendered dubious the
effect and meaning of the entire enactment, by adding, &ldquo;unless in
a case so extraordinary, necessary and imperative that it may appear
convenient to limit this rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will not be extraneous to point out here that this was a common
weakness of many laws, by which they were frequently rendered entirely
inapplicable. In this case, for example, the evident object was to
prevent the <i lang="es">oidores</i> from interfering in Chinese
affairs, thus guaranteeing the government and administration by
officials who were endowed with knowledge and understanding of their
racial characteristics and peculiarities, while centering the ultimate
responsibility for them in the governor. It was realized, however, that
exceptional cases might arise in which some other procedure might be
advisable, and accordingly a loophole was left whereby the entire law
could be nullified. The audiencia was thus given a basis for
intervention in the government of the Chinese whenever it suited the
convenience of the magistrates. This defect is emphasized here because
this particular exception justified the intervention of the audiencia
on many occasions, and was a cause of continual contention between the
governor and the audiencia in Chinese affairs.</p>
<p>Although it is difficult to settle conclusively the question
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>of the extent of jurisdiction which the governor
and the audiencia, respectively, exercised over the Chinese in the
Pari&aacute;n, a few cases may be presented in this connection to show
that both the governor and the audiencia were justified by royal
authority in advancing claims to control. On December 4, 1630, the king
wrote a scathing arraignment of the audiencia for having entertained an
appeal from the Chinese over the head of the governor, practically
disregarding the latter, and for making recommendations relative to the
Chinese and to military affairs, which questions were entirely outside
its province.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10807src" href="#xd21e10807"
name="xd21e10807src">49</a> One of the items of the report of the
recent visitor-general to the Philippines, Licentiate Francisco de
Rojas y Ornate in 1629, had been a charge that the audiencia had
condemned and fined a Chinese merchant for smuggling munitions of war
into the colony, after the latter had proved that he had been acting
under the instructions of Governor Silva.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10810src" href="#xd21e10810" name="xd21e10810src">50</a> The
visitor-general took the position that this case was entirely within
the military sphere; therefore the governor&rsquo;s decision was final,
and the audiencia was proceeding without jurisdiction in attempting to
deal with it. The king called upon the tribunal to justify its action
in the matter.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10813src" href="#xd21e10813"
name="xd21e10813src">51</a> It is to be noted that in this case the
point at issue was not that the audiencia was interfering with a
Chinaman who should have been punished by another authority, but that
in assuming jurisdiction the audiencia had infringed on the special
prerogatives of the governor with regard to war and government. The
frequency and seriousness of the Chinese insurrections in the early
seventeenth century, and the fear of a hostile invasion from China,
placed all questions of dealing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252"
href="#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>with the Chinese upon a
military basis, hence the authority of the governor.</p>
<p>Much correspondence of various kinds might be cited to show that the
governor was encouraged to consult the audiencia on Chinese affairs.
Not only was the governor expected to do this, but the king himself
directed many letters to the &ldquo;governor and audiencia&rdquo; and
to the &ldquo;governor and <i lang="es">oidores</i>,&rdquo; in which he
asked for advice and information bearing upon Chinese affairs. As we
have already seen, <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> treating of these
matters were frequently expedited to the &ldquo;governor and
audiencia.&rdquo; The audiencia was requested by the royal authority on
August 8, 1609, to submit information as to the truth of various
statements by persons in the Islands that the Chinese were carrying
away vast quantities of silver. The audiencia was ordered to enact
measures which would stop this abuse, which, if persisted in, would
inevitably result in an impoverishment of the Philippine community and
government. The <i lang="es">oidores</i> were asked to suggest a course
of action which would result in the retention of the Chinese trade and
at the same time prevent the Chinese from doing irreparable damage to
the royal exchequer in the ways alluded to.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10829src" href="#xd21e10829" name="xd21e10829src">52</a></p>
<p>In further illustration of the same subject, we may note the
instructions of the king to Governor Silva, dated March 27, 1616. On
this occasion the king prescribed a course of action for the governor
to follow in case of the invasion of the Islands by the Chinese and
Japanese. He was especially directed to prevent a union of the Chinese
in the Pari&aacute;n with the forces of the expected invaders. Silva
was ordered to take no steps without first consulting the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10837src" href=
"#xd21e10837" name="xd21e10837src">53</a> On July 25, 1619, having
received news of the insubordination of the Chinese in Manila and of
the danger of a revolt among them, the king wrote to the
&ldquo;president and <i lang="es">oidores</i>&rdquo; expressing the
belief that too <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253"
name="pb253">253</a>]</span>many Chinese had been admitted to the
Islands and that thereafter only enough should be permitted to man the
ships and carry on trade.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10845src" href=
"#xd21e10845" name="xd21e10845src">54</a> The authorities to whom this
letter was directed were charged not to allow the royal will relative
to this matter to be disregarded, which, of course, implied the
exercise of an executive power on the part of the magistrates, in
addition to consultative authority.</p>
<p>Again, on December 31, 1630, the king wrote to the governor and
audiencia, stating that there had been received at the court from the
Chinese of the Pari&aacute;n, a series of memorials, letters and
petitions, complaining against the rigor of Spanish administration and
requesting that they might be governed by mandarins, governors and
<i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> of the &ldquo;Chinese nation.&rdquo;
The king signified his unwillingness to comply with their request at
this time, and accordingly ordered the governor and audiencia to permit
no changes to be made.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10856src" href=
"#xd21e10856" name="xd21e10856src">55</a> On July 27, 1713, the
tribunal, acting in a legislative capacity, decreed that within thirty
days &ldquo;all Moros, Armenians, Malabars, Chinese and other enemies
of the Holy Faith&rdquo; should be lodged in the Pari&aacute;n when
visiting Manila, or when living there temporarily for purposes of visit
or trade. Penalties were also prescribed for the infraction of the
above law.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10862src" href="#xd21e10862"
name="xd21e10862src">56</a> This affords one illustration out of many
which could be cited of the legislation of the audiencia in Chinese
affairs.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10867src" href="#xd21e10867" name=
"xd21e10867src">57</a></p>
<p>On May 14, 1790, the king wrote to the &ldquo;governor and president
of the royal audiencia&rdquo; and also to the tribunal, ordering the
re-establishment of the Pari&aacute;n. This Chinese quarter had been
abolished since 1756. It was agreed that the Chinese in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>this
district should be ruled by an <i lang="es">alcalde</i>, who should
also hear cases in first instance, with appeal to the audiencia. It was
furthermore decreed that the Chinese population in the Islands should
be fixed at 4000 and that each individual should be taxed at the rate
of six pesos <i>per capita</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10884src"
href="#xd21e10884" name="xd21e10884src">58</a> This tax was to be
collected by the <i lang="es">cabecilla</i> of the Chinese, a sort of
local leader, subject to the <i lang="es">alcalde</i> of the
Pari&aacute;n. This <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i>, the king stated,
was originally suggested by the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> of the
audiencia, and had been submitted for royal approval, which had been
duly conceded. This correspondence, which shows the real operation of
the government much more accurately than the citation of laws alone
could do, makes it quite clear that throughout the history of the
Islands, notwithstanding the existence of many <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dulas</i> to the contrary, the audiencia exercised
advisory power in regard to the government of the Chinese. This
authority was repeatedly recognized by the governor and by the king
himself.</p>
<p>After the inauguration of the superintendency of <i lang="es">real
hacienda</i> at Manila in 1787, the incumbent of that office was made
largely responsible for the Chinese. This was probably so arranged
because the care and administration of the Chinese at that time
involved questions of finance rather than of war and defense. It will
be remembered, too, that, during much of the time, the office of
superintendent was combined with that of governor. A number of disputes
arose between the governor and the intendant after the latter office
was created in 1785,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10914src" href=
"#xd21e10914" name="xd21e10914src">59</a> but after the union of the
governorship with the superintendency, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb255" href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>no further occasion
of dispute arose. During the greater part of the nineteenth century,
the peculiar nature of the office of intendant gave to the latter
official the duty of collecting the licenses of the Chinese, subject to
the superintendent.</p>
<p>There yet remains something to be said regarding the administration
of justice among the Chinese, and we must note certain typical disputes
and disagreements which arose in that connection. That the audiencia
had authority to try cases in second instance involving the Chinese has
already been stated. Likewise the <i lang="es">oidores</i> were liable
to special delegation to try cases of an extraordinary character which
arose among the Chinese, as, for example in 1786, when Oidor
Bol&iacute;var y Me&ntilde;a was designated to try in first instance
charges which had been made against Chinese bakers in the
Pari&aacute;n, who were said to have put a quantity of powdered glass
in bread which they had made for the Spaniards. This case was regarded
as one of more than ordinary significance, as involving treason and
insurrection, and it was accordingly tried by an <i lang="es">oidor</i>
who had been especially delegated for the purpose by the
governor.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10927src" href="#xd21e10927" name=
"xd21e10927src">60</a></p>
<p>The question of Chinese jurisdiction is further illustrated by a
dispute which arose in the colony between the audiencia and the
governor, and which was carried to the king by the latter functionary
on June 30, 1793. Oidor Moreno had ordered the arrest of the Chinese
<i lang="es">cabecilla</i> of the Pari&aacute;n on a criminal
charge.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10937src" href="#xd21e10937" name=
"xd21e10937src">61</a> The detention of the Chinaman was conceded to be
justifiable, but Governor Marquina alleged that Moreno had entirely
disregarded the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of October 11, 1784,
which had ordered that in case of the arrest of any royal official,
notification should be served to the governor in sufficient time for
him to take the proper precautions for the safeguarding of any of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>His Majesty&rsquo;s property which might be in
the care or under the protection of the official in question. He said
that this particular arrest was typical of the petty interference of
the <i lang="es">oidores</i> and illustrative of the slight pretexts
upon which they frequently upset the whole system of government and
caused untold annoyances. On account of the many difficulties in the
collection of the tribute which had presented themselves as a
consequence of the arrest of this particular Chinese official, and
because the latter was especially efficient, the governor had asked the
audiencia to permit the <i lang="es">cabecilla</i> to be excused on
condition that he should bind himself to return to the custody of the
audiencia after he had collected the taxes. This the tribunal had
refused. The government, as a consequence, had been put to much
inconvenience in finding a substitute, and the sum collected had been
considerably less than was usually obtained, owing to the lack of
experience of the new collector. After the <i lang="es">cabecilla</i>
had been in prison over four months, he was brought to trial, and
nothing being proved against him, he was freed. The audiencia, however,
had won its point, and had manifested its right to the last word in
judicial affairs relating to the Chinese.</p>
<p>The difference between the appellate jurisdiction of the audiencia
in contentious cases involving Chinese and in administrative matters
which it did not have is illustrated by a case which came up in 1794
and lasted through twelve years of litigation. In the year
aforementioned, the <i lang="es">ayuntamiento</i> of Manila brought
suit before an <i lang="es">alcalde ordinario</i> of the city against a
Chinese, August&iacute;n Chagisco, on a charge of the failure of the
latter properly to fulfill a contract which he had made to supply the
city with meat. The <i lang="es">alcalde ordinario</i>, before whom
suit had been brought in first instance, cancelled the contract, and
the Chinese appealed to the audiencia. The tribunal, after due
consideration of the case, restored Chagisco to his status as provider
of meats (<i lang="es">abastecedor de carne</i>) for the city. Instead
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>appealing the case as one of law, the <i lang=
"es">ayuntamiento</i> wrote to the king on January 19, 1796, alleging
that the audiencia had interfered in behalf of a Chinese whose services
the <i lang="es">ayuntamiento</i> had discontinued as provider of
meats, over which matter the audiencia had no jurisdiction. The king
immediately gave expression of his approval of the stand of the
<i lang="es">ayuntamiento</i>, being of the impression that the
question at stake was one of appointment only.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10981src" href="#xd21e10981" name="xd21e10981src">62</a> At the
same time the king demanded a full explanation from the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> as to why they had interfered in this matter which was
so far removed from their jurisdiction. The audiencia, in reply, sent
all the records and <i lang="es">testimonios</i> of the suit to the
Council, and that tribunal called upon the <i lang=
"es">ayuntamiento</i> in due time to explain why it had misrepresented
the case. After a long period of acrimonious correspondence between the
Manila authorities, the case was concluded on February 19, 1806, by a
reversal of the earlier decision, and His Majesty sent a letter of
congratulation and approval to the audiencia in appreciation of its
stand in the matter.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10994src" href=
"#xd21e10994" name="xd21e10994src">63</a> The king informed the
tribunal that it had been entirely regular in its proceedings, having
reversed the decision of the <i lang="es">alcalde ordinario</i> in a
legal suit which had been appealed by the Chinese to the audiencia in
protest against the adverse decision of the lower court.</p>
<p>Without carrying this discussion further, it is clear that the
audiencia had general appellate jurisdiction in cases involving the
Chinese. These cases, when they originated in the Pari&aacute;n, were
tried in first instance by special judges for the Chinese, but suits
brought against a Chinese who lived outside, or suits of a semi-public
nature, as the one just noted, might be tried in first instance by the
ordinary judges. It has also been noted that <i lang="es">oidores</i>
were sometimes delegated to try cases in first instance involving
treason or insurrection of Chinese. In regard <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>to
matters of government, it may be said that the governor was held
responsible, but even in these the <i lang="es">oidores</i>
participated in an advisory capacity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

March 12, 1781, Governor Basco y Vargas complained to the king against
the inconvenience of having to appeal the decisions of the local
council of war to the Supreme Council in Madrid. This was the practice
followed in other parts, he said, but it was undesirable in the
Philippines on account of the isolation and the distance. He
recommended instead that these cases should be appealed to a board
consisting of the governor and two <i lang="es">asesores</i>&mdash;one
his own, and the other an <i lang="es">oidor</i> to be designated by
him. This recommendation was not accepted (A. I.,

Memorial of April 19, 1586, Blair and Robertson, VI, 197&ndash;233. The
purpose of the proposed expedition was declared to be to
&ldquo;forestall the danger that the French and English, and other
heretics and northern nations, will discover and navigate that strait
which certainly lies opposite those regions&mdash;that of
Labrador.&rdquo; A note suggests that this probably referred to the St.
Lawrence River. Delgado says that Governor Sande called this council
together on April 9, 1586, evidently meaning Santiago de Vera, as the
latter became governor in 1584, and Sande left the Islands in 1580. De
Vera&rsquo;s signature is affixed to this petition. Other letters of
special importance, from the audiencia or individual <i lang=

written during this period, may be noted in Blair and Robertson, VI,

On the occasion referred to, it acted as a courtmartial. It also had
power to advise the governor, and even to prevent the military
officials from taking steps which would inflict injustice on the
natives in connection with military operations. Here it may be seen
that magistrates were actually members of this council, and in this
capacity they advised the governor as to the best means of fortifying
and defending the Islands. The laws of the Indies are singularly
lacking in definite statements as to the legal composition and
membership of this council.</p>

de Morga, writing in his <i lang="es">Sucesos</i> in 1609, described
the Chinese government of the Pari&aacute;n as follows: &ldquo;The
Chinese have a governor of their own race, a Christian, who has his
officials and assistants. He hears their cases in affairs of justice,
in their domestic and business affairs; appeals from him go to the
alcalde-mayor of Tondo, or of the Pari&aacute;n, and from all these to
the Audiencia, which also gives especial attention to this nation and
whatever pertains to it&rdquo; (Morga&rsquo;s Sucesos, Blair and
Robertson, XVI, 197). See W. L. Schurz, &ldquo;The Chinese in the
Philippines,&rdquo; in <i>The Pacific Ocean in history</i>,
214&ndash;222.</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10758" href="#xd21e10758src" name="xd21e10758">46</a></span> The
Chinese were altogether too shrewd in business for the other residents
of Manila. The desire to avoid trouble and to keep from provoking the
Chinese to rebellion were also factors, and there were institutional
and religious reasons. The Chinese were of different race and heritage
and their practices and beliefs were regarded by the Catholic Spaniards
as altogether heathenish and heretical, and judging by almost any
standard of morality and cleanliness it must be conceded that some of
them at least were indecent and revolting.</p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE AUDIENCIA AND THE GOVERNOR: CONFLICTS OF
JURISDICTION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Although it may be said that the relations of the
governor and the audiencia were comparatively peaceful and harmonious
throughout the history of the Philippines, there were many conflicts of
jurisdiction and these struggles for power assume great prominence on
account of their bitterness. An investigation of the principles
underlying them and the arguments advanced by the contending parties
will go far towards explaining the relationship of the audiencia with
the governor.</p>
<p>Certain factors and conditions were always prevalent in the colony
to cause trouble and provoke enmity between the governor and the
<i lang="es">oidores</i>. Chief among these were the rivalry between
them for commercial profits, jealously of power and advancement, and
the desire on the part of all, and particularly of the governors, to
enrich themselves. Officials tended to regard their appointments as
commissions to engage in profitable ventures and business
undertakings&mdash;opportunities which were to be immediately improved.
It is probable that the presence of the audiencia did more to check
this tendency than any other agency, for the documents bearing on the
history of the colony are replete with charges made by <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> and <i lang="es">fiscales</i> against governors. It is
also true that the <i lang="es">oidores</i> did effective work in
correcting the misdeeds of the provincial governors and justices on
their official tours of inspection. That the audiencia should
accomplish this result was to be expected, since the leading purpose of
its establishment was to check the excesses of the governor. The other
side of the question cannot be neglected, however, for charges were
made in sufficient <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260"
name="pb260">260</a>]</span>number against the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i>. It is with these charges and counter-charges,
memorials, complaints, and arguments that the present chapter is
concerned.</p>
<p>The method to be pursued in this chapter will be that of indicating
in all fairness both sides of these conflicts, not with the purpose of
seeing which side was right, but with the object of obtaining the
respective viewpoints of the governors and magistrates. We shall first
consider evidence which was submitted in behalf of the audiencia
against the governor, and in turn, that of the governors against the
<i lang="es">oidores</i>. This method of procedure is the only one
feasible since the materials here utilized consist mostly of arguments
for or against the governor or audiencia, respectively.</p>
<p>We have already seen that the first notorious disagreement in the
colony arose between Bishop Salazar and Governors Ronquillo de
Pe&ntilde;alosa and Santiago de Vera. This occurred before the
establishment of the audiencia. The audiencia was in fact established
partly to have an impartial tribunal present to arbitrate such
disputes, and partly to check the excesses of the governor.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e11047src" href="#xd21e11047" name=
"xd21e11047src">1</a> We have also given attention to the charges made
by Oidor D&aacute;valos against his fellow-magistrates and the governor
shortly after the audiencia was established. It has been noted that the
incessant quarreling between the governor and the audiencia from 1584
to 1589 was one of the causes for abolishing the tribunal at the latter
date. From 1590 to 1595 the governor was supreme in matters of
government, war, and justice. It was clearly shown during this period
that the discord <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261"
name="pb261">261</a>]</span>of a quarrelsome tribunal was eminently to
be preferred to the unchecked abuses of an autocratic governor. In 1595
the audiencia was re-established by royal enactment; from that date
onward it became a permanent part of the government, notwithstanding
the fact that its relations with the other institutions of the colony
were not harmonious.</p>
<p>There were two complaints most frequently made against governors.
One of these was their commercial excesses and the other, their abuse
of the power of appointment. The former consisted of the monopoly of
galleon space for themselves, or their friends, the acceptance of
bribes from merchants for various favors, or the manipulation of the
Chinese trade in some way for their own advantage. The tendency of
governors to appoint their friends and relatives to office,
notwithstanding the royal prohibition, and the apparent inability of
the audiencia to prevent this was a source of complaint, especially
during the early years of the colony.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11060src" href="#xd21e11060" name="xd21e11060src">2</a> Dishonest
proceedings in the sale of offices, including the retention of the
money received and the disposal of offices to friends for nominal sums,
were among the irregularities of the early governors. These abuses the
magistrates often knowingly permitted in return for some favor allowed
them by the governor. That the laws which forbade these abuses of the
power of appointment had been openly and flagrantly violated was a
charge brought up repeatedly in the <i lang="es">residencias</i> of
governors and magistrates. An examination of the correspondence of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries would almost lead to the belief
that the home government despaired of ever righting these wrongs, and
left them unpunished, rather directing efforts towards reform in other
channels in the hope of remedying greater defects.</p>
<p>Perhaps no governor more flagrantly disregarded the audiencia and
the royal authority which it represented, or more <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>frequently laid himself open to complaints on
account of his violent conduct than Alonso Fajardo, who ruled from 1618
to 1624. Numerous charges were brought against him by the audiencia,
some of which concerned itself, and some had to do with the general
administration of the government. It was charged that Fajardo sought to
usurp the judicial functions of the tribunal, and to assume control of
the administration of justice. He had on one occasion broken up a
session of the court during the trial of a certain person for murder,
ordering a sergeant to take him out and hang him. Fajardo defended
himself against this accusation by alleging that the criminal was a
sailor from the royal fleet, whom he, as captain-general, had already
condemned, and that the audiencia was acting illegally in entertaining
the case. Fajardo was said to have released prisoners at his own
pleasure, and to have abused the pardoning power. He had made threats
of violence against the magistrates in the court-room.</p>
<p>The audiencia not only complained against this governor&rsquo;s
interference with the exercise of its functions as a court, but it
manifested a wider interest than the purely judicial by complaining
against the excesses of the governor in his own administrative field.
The charge was made that Fajardo had bought up due-bills and treasury
certificates from the soldiers and other creditors of the government,
at less than their face value, and had presented them to the <i lang=
"es">oficiales reales</i>, realizing the full amount on them, and
retaining the proceeds. He was charged with exacting large sums from
the Chinese in exchange for trading privileges, retaining the money
himself instead of putting it into the treasury. He was said to have
forced loans from the merchants in order to make up financial deficits,
and to have taken money out of the treasury, secretly, at night.
Another charge brought against him was that of allowing favorites to go
out and meet the incoming ships of the Chinese, thereby obtaining for
himself and for them the choice parts of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>the cargoes in
advance of the merchants of Manila.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11080src" href="#xd21e11080" name="xd21e11080src">3</a> There is
no evidence that the tribunal was able to put a stop to these
abuses.</p>
<p>Oidor &Aacute;lvaro Messa y Lugo, in a letter written to the king on
July 20, 1622, continued the campaign which had been started by the
audiencia against this governor. He claimed that Fajardo had sought to
prevent officials and private citizens from sending complaints to Spain
against him by examining all the outgoing mail before it left the
colony. The <i lang="es">oidor</i> showed that wastefulness, private
trade, bribery, carelessness in the administration of the exchequer,
neglect of shipbuilding, corruption, and personal violence were among
the misdeeds of this governor. Messa reported that he had tried
unsuccessfully to authorize the auditing of the accounts of the galleon
for two successive years, in accordance with the royal instructions
which ordered that it should be done at the termination of each voyage
by the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> and two <i lang=
"es">oidores</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11100src" href=
"#xd21e11100" name="xd21e11100src">4</a> Messa said that the governor
feared to have the colony&rsquo;s finances examined for it was well
known that they were in a deplorable state.</p>
<p>One instance of the governor&rsquo;s financial ingenuity which was
given by Messa, illustrates the limitations placed by the audiencia on
the governor&rsquo;s appointing power. The audiencia relieved the
secretary of government, Pedro Mu&ntilde;oz, of his office upon the
expiration of his term, selling the place to Diego de Rueda for 8000
pesos. Fajardo dispossessed Rueda and restored the office to its former
incumbent for 1500 pesos. The audiencia&rsquo;s action in disposing of
this office without the consent of the governor was justified by a law
promulgated on November 13, 1581, ordering that offices should be
bestowed only upon persons of such qualities and attributes as met with
the approval of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264"
name="pb264">264</a>]</span>royal justices.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11113src" href="#xd21e11113" name="xd21e11113src">5</a> The
governor emerged triumphant in this contest, however, because it was
generally recognized at that time that his word should be final in
matters of appointment. Although we have seen in a former chapter that
the governor consulted with the audiencia when an important appointment
was to be made, the audiencia&rsquo;s intervention in matters of
appointment depended largely on the strength of the tribunal and the
relations existing between it and the governor. During this
administration the audiencia was notoriously weak and harmony did not
exist.</p>
<p>The memorial presented by Messa y Lugo was chiefly concerned with
the story of his own arbitrary arrest and imprisonment at the
instigation of Fajardo on trumped-up charges, as he alleged. The
judicial inquiry lasted two months, and it furnishes an excellent
example of the power of a governor over a weak audiencia. The occasion
for the investigation had been a disagreement between the governor and
the <i lang="es">oidor</i> over the latter&rsquo;s claim to act as
administrator of the property of Oidor Alcaraz, who had died in office.
The governor, by the appointment of a magistrate favorable to himself
as <i lang="es">juez de difuntos</i>, had hoped to control the
administration of the property, since Messa was under sentence of
<i lang="es">residencia</i>, and the remaining magistrates of the
audiencia were favorable to him. Moreover, Fajardo wished to forestall
certain charges of misgovernment which he knew that Messa was prepared
to make against him. Consequently the governor designated an <i lang=
"es">alcalde</i> of the city to conduct the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>. Messa was given practically no opportunity to
defend himself. His property was sequestrated, even to his wife&rsquo;s
clothing. Seeing that he could not obtain justice, he escaped from
prison and took refuge in a Dominican convent.</p>
<p>Messa, from the seclusion of the monastery, challenged the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>legality of the governor&rsquo;s procedure.
According to his contention, the previous law authorizing the governor
to name an <i lang="es">alcalde ordinario</i> to try an <i lang=
"es">oidor</i>, was now a dead-letter. Its chief defect had been that
an <i lang="es">alcalde</i>, who was the creature of the governor,
would always aim to render a decision pleasing to his master. He urged
that the law then in force authorized the governor to proceed with the
trial of an <i lang="es">oidor</i>, only upon consulting the audiencia,
and moreover that resulting condemnations, if they were personal or
corporal, should be confirmed by the Council of the Indies.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e11153src" href="#xd21e11153" name=
"xd21e11153src">6</a> Messa therefore claimed that the governor had no
authority to proceed with this case alone, since &ldquo;those nearest
(your Majesty), as are the auditors (<i lang="es">oidores</i>), cannot
be imprisoned or proceeded against except by your Majesty or the royal
Council, or by your order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">oidor</i> then proceeded to show the extent to
which, in his opinion, the governor might intervene in the sessions and
proceedings of the audiencia. He wrote:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The president, in virtue of his superintendency over
the Audiencia, may ordain to the auditors what may be the just and
reasonable in matters that pertain to the government and its
conservation; and even, in the heated arguments that are wont to arise
between the auditors, has authority, in case the nature of the affair
might require it, to retire each auditor to his own house, until they
make up the quarrel; and, should he deem it advisable, he may inform
your Majesty. For the ordinance does not say that the president and
alcaldes shall proceed, arrest, sentence and execute justice in
criminal cases affecting the auditors.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11169src" href="#xd21e11169" name="xd21e11169src">7</a></p>
</div>
<p>This is the interpretation which Messa placed upon the law giving
authority over the trial of magistrates of the audiencia to the
governor.</p>
<p>Messa then proceeded to discuss other matters relative to the
respective spheres of the governor and audiencia. The governor had
broken open the chest of the audiencia, extracting a large sum and
spending it without accounting for the expenditure, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>and
without any beneficial results. He was guilty of four murders, one of
his victims being his wife. The audiencia should be empowered to try
him for these crimes, but it lacked jurisdiction. During his term
Fajardo had exercised such absolute power that justice had been
paralyzed and litigants were holding back their suits from trial
because justice could not be obtained in the audiencia. The governor
had sent from the Islands more than a million pesos in goods and money,
all of which he had obtained through fraudulent and illegitimate
means.</p>
<p>The governor had quarreled finally with the <i lang="es">oidores</i>
who had remained faithful to him; one of these had become incapacitated
through sickness, while the other had taken refuge in a Jesuit convent.
The audiencia was thus dissolved. The governor, feeling the need of a
tribunal, withdrew the charges against Messa, and ordered the latter to
come back and resume his office. The <i lang="es">oidor</i> complied,
but his hostility toward the governor had in no way abated. Messa
concluded his memorial with the request that a visitor should be sent
to the colony to investigate the charges which had been made against
the governor, and at the same time to restore the audiencia to its
rightful position in the colony. He stated his conviction that the
office of governor should be abolished, and that the audiencia should
be empowered to act in his place. This belief he justified by the
statement that the audiencia had already successfully acted in the
capacity of governor and had administered affairs with great
satisfaction.</p>
<p>The power which the governor had of imprisoning and chastising
magistrates of the audiencia who dared to oppose him, enabled him to
emerge victorious in his struggles with that body. He was even able to
completely suppress the audiencia. Nevertheless he was obliged, through
the need of the tribunal which he had vanquished, to restore it again,
although it was opposed to him. In no less than three cases governors,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>in order to comply with the law requiring that
there should be at least one <i lang="es">oidor</i> of royal
appointment, were obliged to restore to the audiencia magistrates who
had formerly been under arrest. Being in possession of all the powers
of an executive, the governor was usually able to reduce the audiencia
to subserviency, unless the dispositions of the opposing <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> were such that they would not submit. On the whole,
the audiencia seemed unable to check the excesses of the governor, by
virtue of its authority, and the <i lang="es">oidores</i> were obliged
to confine themselves to protests and appeals to the king; these, only
after years of delay, effected the removal or punishment of the
governor and the appointment of another to continue his excesses.</p>
<p>The complaints which Messa made on this occasion resulted in
bringing to the Islands a visitor who conducted a lengthy, though
somewhat tardy, investigation. Fajardo was already beyond the
punishment of earthy kings and tribunals. But his property was seized
and his heirs were fined; aside, however, from the removal of various
of Fajardo&rsquo;s subordinates, the government was but little better
for the protestations and appeals made by the audiencia. The <i lang=
"es">oidores</i>, instead of obtaining the desired reform measures,
were usually rewarded for opposing a tyrannical governor and appealing
to the court for support, by a reprimand for quarreling and an
admonition to be quiet and peaceful, to preserve harmony, to attend
strictly to their own affairs, and to abstain from interference with
the government. Indeed, judging from the many similar replies which the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> received in answer to their charges against
governors, it appears that the preservation of harmonious relations
between the officials of the colony was much more important than good
government. Usually, however, in these struggles between the audiencia
and the governor the contentions of one side or the other were based on
law and justice. The effectiveness of the Spanish colonial government
would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>have been greatly increased had the Council of
the Indies taken advantage of these opportunities to investigate the
principles at stake and support the right side, rather than by issuing
impotent injunctions and remonstrances.</p>
<p>The most significant controversy which ever occurred in the
Philippines between the governor and the audiencia arose in connection
with the banishment of Archbishop Pardo in 1683. It is not the purpose
here to give a detailed account of the Pardo controversy, which will be
discussed again in connection with the relations of the audiencia and
the church. However, since this episode involves certain incidents
illustrating important phases of the relationship of the governor and
the audiencia, it is desirable to refer to it here in considerable
detail.</p>
<p>The real occasion for this conflict was the defiance of the laws of
the royal ecclesiastical patronage by the archbishop, who insisted on
making ecclesiastical appointments without consulting the governor. The
governor appealed to the audiencia for support, and the tribunal
exercised jurisdiction over the case on the basis of its right to try
cases of <i lang="es">fuerza</i> and to prevent ecclesiastical judges
from infringing on the civil jurisdiction. Juan S&aacute;nchez, the
secretary of the audiencia, relates that, owing to the interference of
the Dominicans and Jesuits, and their harsh public criticism from the
pulpit of the audiencia and government, &ldquo;the royal Audiencia felt
obliged to advise its president, then Don Juan de Vargas, that he
should apply a corrective to these acts.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11219src" href="#xd21e11219" name="xd21e11219src">8</a> This
corrective was the banishment to Spain of certain individuals of the
Dominican order to answer for their misdeeds and ultimately the exile
of Archbishop Pardo from the city. It is enough to say that Governor
Juan de Vargas Hurtado and the audiencia acted in harmony on this
occasion, presenting a solid front to the ecclesiastical power. When
the new governor, Curuzaelegui, arrived, however, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>he
forced the audiencia to ask pardon and absolution from the archbishop,
which the magistrates did on their knees. The new governor disgraced
Vargas in the <i lang="es">residencia</i>, waiving for a time the
<i lang="es">residencias</i> of the <i lang="es">oidores</i>. Pardo was
recalled from exile, and the audiencia was forced to legalize his
restoration to his see on October 25, 1684. Thus the new governor and
the archbishop triumphed over the combined forces of the ex-governor
and the audiencia.</p>
<p>It is clear that the power of the new governor was derived chiefly
from his status as royal vicepatron, acting in conjunction with the
archbishop. This power Vargas had formerly employed in co-operation
with the audiencia, and thereby both had gained their victory over the
prelate before the arrival of the new governor. Curuzaelegui used the
same authority to recall Pardo; and in so doing he was probably the
only governor in the history of the Islands who ever supported a
prelate against the advice of the audiencia. The combination of a
governor and an audiencia was much more frequent, as we shall see. The
position of the governor was strengthened, also, by his commission to
conduct the <i lang="es">residencia</i> of Vargas, and the respect
which the audiencia had for him was increased by the fact that in
judging the ex-governor&rsquo;s misdeeds he was also authorized to hold
the <i lang="es">oidores</i> responsible for all their official
opinions and acts in <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> with the disgraced
governor.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11245src" href="#xd21e11245" name=
"xd21e11245src">9</a> Another source of the governor&rsquo;s strength
was to be found in the royal instructions which he carried with him to
stop the quarrels previously existing in the colony. The <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> very prudently submitted to the new governor, and
therefore, for a time, they were patronized by the latter, who utilized
their intimate knowledge of local affairs to aid him in obtaining
control of the government and familiarizing himself with it. Meanwhile
he literally held the <i lang="es">residencia</i> over their heads.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span></p>
<p>The attitude of the new governor toward the audiencia during the
first six months may be described as conciliatory. That he did not act
with entire independence of it is attested by the fact that when Vargas
appealed to the tribunal against the ecclesiastical penalties imposed
by the archbishop, the governor signed the act ordering the absolution
of his predecessor. When the archbishop persisted in his intention to
humiliate Vargas on the ground that the Inquisition demanded such
action, the new governor threatened again to expel the prelate if he
did not desist.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11262src" href="#xd21e11262"
name="xd21e11262src">10</a> His pacificatory efforts also resulted in a
temporary cessation of the hostility between the archbishop and the
audiencia; he held private conferences with the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i>, manifesting repeatedly his determination to proceed
harmoniously with them. As a result of this treatment, the magistrates
were emboldened to urge that the return of the prelate was contrary to
law, and inconsistent with all precedent.</p>
<p>Finally, unable to resist the pressure exerted by the archbishop,
and obtaining advance information of the royal condemnation of the
audiencia for its acts in the banishment of Pardo, the governor
arrested, imprisoned, and exiled the magistrates, temporarily
reconstituting the tribunal with local and more subservient
members.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11273src" href="#xd21e11273" name=
"xd21e11273src">11</a> Curuzaelegui&rsquo;s proceedings were
thenceforth as high-handed as they had formerly been conciliatory, and
from that time onward the residents of the colony were subjected to the
rule of an absolute governor, aided by an unscrupulous and vindictive
prelate and a subservient audiencia. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb271" href="#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>Just before his
imprisonment, Magistrate Bol&iacute;var, in a letter to the Minister of
the Indies, described the chaos existent in Manila as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Here there is no will, save that of a governor, since
he is absolute, we all had to acquiesce, under compulsion and pressure,
in the restitution of the archbishop;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11284src" href="#xd21e11284" name="xd21e11284src">12</a> ... to
state the case in few words, the archbishop does whatever suits his
whim, without there being anyone to restrain him.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11290src" href="#xd21e11290" name="xd21e11290src">13</a></p>
</div>
<p>Fray Lu&iacute;s Pimentel, a Jesuit, in a letter which he wrote to a
friend, stated that the arrest of the <i lang="es">oidores</i> by the
governor had been inspired by personal spite and a desire for revenge.
He had desired to punish magistrates Viga and Bol&iacute;var,
particularly for their opposition to him in matters of administration
and in his trading-schemes. The governor was also said to have been
actuated by a suspicion that these <i lang="es">oidores</i> had
formulated elaborate charges of misgovernment against him, and he
desired to prevent these complaints from reaching the king.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e11303src" href="#xd21e11303" name=
"xd21e11303src">14</a></p>
<p>Pimentel proceeded to relate that the governor then found himself
embarrassed without the aid of an audiencia, and had accordingly formed
another of his own selection. This body was careful to execute the
governor&rsquo;s will in every particular; consequently there was no
check on his misrule. This new audiencia approved all the acts of the
archbishop and refused to entertain the appeals of the ex-governor,</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">royal decrees were despatched against the preachers
(Jesuits) who zealously proclaimed from the pulpits the arbitrary and
malicious character of the recent acts, and the Dominicans alone had
the privilege to utter whatever absurdities they pleased in the
pulpits.... No <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=

years can be sent to the court for the scriveners are intimidated and
will not give official statements of what occurs, except what may be in
favor of the governor and the archbishop. <i>Item</i>, (this) is
written in much distrust and fear, on account of the numerous spies who
go about prying into and noting everything that is done.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e11316src" href="#xd21e11316" name=
"xd21e11316src">15</a></p>
</div>
<p>Pimentel stated that the archbishop, who was a Dominican, had used
this rupture between the governor and the audiencia, and the favor of
the governor, particularly, as an occasion and pretext for imposing on
the Jesuits and Franciscans. He had deprived them of their lands and
parishes, and had obtained many favors for the Dominicans and
Augustinians at the expense of the rival orders. &ldquo;It seems as if
the governor had come to the islands,&rdquo; Pimentel wrote, &ldquo;for
nothing else than to encourage the Dominicans in their rebellious acts,
to trample on the laws, to abolish recourse to the royal Audiencia, to
sow dissension, to be a tyrant, to disturb the peace, and to enable the
archbishop to secure whatever he wishes, even though he imposes so
grievous a captivity on the commonwealth.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11321src" href="#xd21e11321" name="xd21e11321src">16</a></p>
<p>The Pardo controversy and its consequences show the extremes to
which a weakened audiencia was reduced on occasion by a new governor
who came to the Islands, armed with recent royal decrees instructing
him to bring about peace and order. Curuzaelegui, assisted by the royal
visitor, who bore instructions even more recent than those of the
governor, imprisoned and exiled the <i lang="es">oidores</i>,
confiscated their property and brought about their ruination and death.
He then appointed another audiencia of his own choice. All these acts
were strictly legal, and in accordance with his instructions. The
governor&rsquo;s conduct before the appointment of the visitor was more
lenient and tolerant than afterwards. This shows that he realized the
necessity of fulfilling the royal will, the policies of which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>were entrusted to Valdivia for execution, even
at the expense of harmony with the local tribunal. Had he not been
assured of the support of the church on the one hand, and of the royal
approval on the other, as shown by the commission of Valdivia, it is
improbable that he would have broken with the audiencia, or would have
attempted to use his power so extensively. The presence of an audiencia
was necessary to the government of Curuzaelegui. This is shown by his
conciliatory attitude toward the tribunal of Vargas, until he knew that
it was under the condemnation of the king, also by his own act in
forming a new one. This controversy clearly illustrates the extent to
which a governor might use his power, and it shows, on the other hand,
the indispensable character of the audiencia, even at a time when it
was least powerful. Curuzaelegui, in the name of the king, completely
obliterated the legally constituted audiencia, appointing another to
serve until it could be legalized by regular appointment.</p>
<p>Chronologically speaking, the next great struggle which throws light
on the subject which we are considering, occurred during the
administration of Governor Bustamante (1717&ndash;1719). The audiencia
was reduced to a deplorable state of helplessness and inefficiency on
this occasion, and the circumstances surrounding its relationship with
the governor were in many ways similar to those which have been
described. For a period of two and a half years antecedent to the
coming of Bustamante, the government of the Philippines had been
nominally in the hands of the audiencia, but in reality, under the
control of the senior magistrate, Torralba. One of the first acts of
Bustamante, after his arrival in the Islands, was to take the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> of Torralba, and this investigation led him to make
serious charges against the other magistrates. In the <i lang=
"es">residencia</i> which followed, the finances of the colony were
found to be in bad condition, and all the officials of the civil
government, as well as many of the churchmen, were discovered to be
deeply <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>interested in private trade, to the neglect of
their duties and to the detriment of the government. Large amounts of
money were found to have been smuggled without permission into the
colony on the galleon from Mexico. The accounts of the treasury
department were discovered to have been loosely kept, and many of the
officials, including magistrates of the audiencia, were found to be
serving without financial guarantees.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11343src" href="#xd21e11343" name="xd21e11343src">17</a></p>
<p>Bustamante immediately took steps to re-organize the government and
to place the finances of the colony on a sound footing. He put a stop
to the smuggling, forced the merchants to pay the authorized duties,
and imposed fines on those who had been guilty of negligence and
misconduct. At the end of six months the efforts of Bustamante had
netted a sum of 293,000 pesos to the royal treasury. His successful
efforts towards clearing up the finances of the colony, making every
person pay his just dues without regard to position, rank, or
affiliation, and the seeming harshness of his methods incurred general
hostility and contributed largely to his downfall.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e11360src" href="#xd21e11360" name="xd21e11360src">18</a></p>
<p>His investigation of the finances was said to have revealed a
shortage of over 700,000 pesos, for which he held Torralba and the
other magistrates responsible, putting, most of the blame, however, on
Torralba. All but one of the magistrates were arrested and incarcerated
in Fort Santiago. Before this was done, however, Bustamante asked the
advice of the archbishop, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href=
"#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>the religious corporations, and
the universities, as to what steps he should take in the matter. He
recognized that he would be seriously embarrassed without an audiencia,
but the investigations which he had made showed that all of the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> were guilty of misappropriation of the
government funds. Would he be justified in forming an audiencia of his
own selection, composed of duly qualified lawyers, with one minister of
royal designation remaining? It was his opinion that the presence of
one regularly appointed magistrate would lend legality to the entire
tribunal, so he asked advice as to which of the three <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> would be most suitable to retain. He cited as a
precedent in favor of his reconstitution of the audiencia the action of
Governor Curuzaelegui in 1687 and 1688 when he exiled and imprisoned
the <i lang="es">oidores</i> and reformed the audiencia with his own
appointees. Bustamante proposed to do exactly what Curuzaelegui had
done, that is, to act as president himself, appointing the <i lang=
"es">fiscal</i> as <i lang="es">oidor</i>, and designating a duly
qualified lawyer and an assistant <i lang="es">fiscal</i> to fill the
other vacant places. Bustamante expressed an apparently sincere desire
to do justice to all. He desired, particularly, that the administration
of justice in the courts should be allowed to proceed without
interruption and without that loss to the commonwealth which would come
from the absence of a tribunal.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11392src"
href="#xd21e11392" name="xd21e11392src">19</a></p>
<p>The replies given by the orders on this occasion involve important
laws and principles which underlie the nature of the audiencia and its
relation to the governorship. The archbishop, in a subsequent report to
the king on the government of Bustamante, stated that all the religious
authorities in the colony advised the governor against the destruction
of the audiencia, and questioned the authority of the prelate to
constitute another.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11399src" href=
"#xd21e11399" name="xd21e11399src">20</a> It seems, however, from an
investigation of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276"
name="pb276">276</a>]</span>the letters, that the Jesuits counseled the
governor in favor of the proposed action. The reasoning of the Jesuit
theologians was as follows: there should be retained in the
Philippines, according to the <i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n de
Indias</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11407src" href="#xd21e11407"
name="xd21e11407src">21</a> four <i lang="es">oidores</i> and a
<i lang="es">fiscal</i> for the proper administration of justice, and
if the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> were the only remaining member of the
old audiencia he would become an <i lang="es">oidor</i> in case of a
vacancy, by virtue of the recognized law.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11425src" href="#xd21e11425" name="xd21e11425src">22</a> Owing to
the multitudinous duties of the <i lang="es">oidores</i> and to the
great importance of the audiencia, great harm would arise if there were
not enough magistrates. Since the governor&rsquo;s jurisdiction
extended to all departments of government, it was the opinion of the
Jesuits that it was incumbent on him to take such steps as might seem
necessary for the preservation of the government. This was specially
imperative since it was his duty to see that there was no delay or
neglect in the administration of justice. Inasmuch as the audiencia was
indispensable to him as vicepatron in its jurisdiction over
ecclesiastical affairs, and because of its consultative powers in all
affairs of government and finance, the governor should have the right
to create an audiencia, if one did not exist, or if the members who
were regularly constituted by royal appointment were incapacitated from
service.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11433src" href="#xd21e11433" name=
"xd21e11433src">23</a></p>
<p>The opinion of the Dominicans of the University of Santo
Tom&aacute;s differed widely from that advanced by the Jesuits. Their
advice coincided with that of the archbishop, being to the effect that
it would not be convenient to qualify one of the ministers alone, but
that all of them should be restored to the audiencia. This meant that
Bustamante should recede from his position, remove all the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> from prison, and accept them as an audiencia. If the
three <i lang="es">oidores</i> deserved punishment it would be unfair
to the remaining two magistrates to exempt <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>one,
and such action would lay the governor open to charges of inconsistency
and favoritism. The Dominicans contended that only the king in council
could suspend or remove <i lang="es">oidores</i>, and that such power
was not given to any other authority, not even to a viceroy.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e11451src" href="#xd21e11451" name=
"xd21e11451src">24</a> Though</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">in Sicily and Naples this right is granted, in the
Indies the contrary is true, because only the king that appointed them
may suspend them, and it is commanded that the viceroys must not
interfere with or impede their jurisdiction.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11460src" href="#xd21e11460" name="xd21e11460src">25</a></p>
</div>
<p>The Dominicans were of the opinion that the governor had authority
to discipline the <i lang="es">oidores</i>, but in so doing he could
not go so far as to remove them from the tribunal unless commanded to
do so by the Council of the Indies. Whatever disciplinary action the
governor might decide on, it should not be taken on his own authority,
but in the execution of the orders of the Council of the Indies.</p>
<p>This opinion, the Dominicans alleged, was in accordance with the
laws of the Indies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11473src" href=
"#xd21e11473" name="xd21e11473src">26</a> They cited, in support of
their argument, an instance in which the king reproved G&aacute;lvez,
the Viceroy of New Spain, because, without the authority of the
Council, G&aacute;lvez had suspended a magistrate of the Audiencia of
Mexico, whom he should have honored and to &ldquo;whom he should have
accorded the treatment of a colleague.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11478src" href="#xd21e11478" name="xd21e11478src">27</a> The
Dominicans expressed the opinion that the prosperity of the Islands and
the welfare of the government depended on the audiencia, and though it
might be desirable to remove the <i lang="es">oidores</i> for personal
guilt, it could not be done in this case without wrecking the entire
government. The king, himself, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278"
href="#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span>had shown respect for the
inviolability of the audiencia when, in 1710, he had judged all the
ministers to be equally guilty of not having fulfilled the laws and
ordinances on the occasion of the coming to the Islands of the
Patriarch of Antioch,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11495src" href=
"#xd21e11495" name="xd21e11495src">28</a> satisfying himself with the
removal of the <i lang="es">decano</i> only and allowing the other
magistrates to remain.</p>
<p>Disregarding the advice of this learned body, turning a deaf ear to
the protestations of the archbishop, and heeding only the counsel of
the Jesuits, which was more favorable to his wishes, Bustamante
proceeded to execute his own will in a manner which proved distasteful
even to the order whose advice he was following.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11504src" href="#xd21e11504" name="xd21e11504src">29</a> He
arrested and imprisoned the guilty magistrates and created a new
tribunal out of his own clientele, leaving only Villa, a former
magistrate, in office. The latter protested against the action of the
governor, and retired to the convent of Guadalupe, near P&aacute;sig.
Informed that there was a conspiracy against his life and needing the
counsel of some person, or persons, on whom he could rely, Bustamante
was well-nigh desperate. His government, as it then stood, lacked the
complexity of legality which the presence of one <i lang="es">oidor</i>
of royal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>nomination would have given it. In order to
remedy this defect he released Torralba, the guiltiest of the former
magistrates, and the man under arrest for the defalcation of 700,000
pesos of the king&rsquo;s revenue. Torralba&rsquo;s crimes had been
notorious, and the act of Bustamante in associating himself with a
person of the unsavory reputation and the unpopularity of Torralba not
only divorced him from whatever popular sympathy he might have had
among the residents of the colony, but it aroused the hostility and
antagonism of the Jesuits who had been heretofore the governor&rsquo;s
friends. Aside from the unfortunate character of the act, it was also
illegal, being contrary to the law which directed that in case an
<i lang="es">oidor</i> were suspended from his place he should not be
restored without the consent of the king and the Council of the
Indies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11515src" href="#xd21e11515" name=
"xd21e11515src">30</a></p>
<p>The newly constituted audiencia busied itself at once with the task
of government. Archbishop de la Cuesta, among others, questioned the
legality of the tribunal&rsquo;s opposition to the excommunication of
its members. He was arrested by the governor, and then arose the
contest which culminated in the murder of Bustamante, in the
suppression of his audiencia and in the first officially recognized
government by a prelate in the Philippines. The archbishop reappointed
all the former magistrates to office, with the exception of Torralba,
and the misdeeds of the government of Bustamante were saddled upon the
ex-magistrate.</p>
<p>Two noteworthy considerations stand out prominently in connection
with this struggle; first, the influence of the governor over the
audiencia, and his power to deprive regularly appointed magistrates of
their positions and to constitute a new audiencia if he chose,
notwithstanding the prohibition of the laws, and, second, the complete
control by a governor over an audiencia which he had created. It is not
necessary to state that the Madrid government discredited all the later
acts <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>of Bustamante&rsquo;s administration, including
the recall of Torralba, who was a self-confessed criminal under arrest,
when restored by the governor. There is nothing to show, however, that
the king disapproved of the acts of Bustamante in creating a new
audiencia, unless it were the royal approval of Cuesta&rsquo;s act of
reconstituting the old tribunal. Torralba, in his <i lang=
"es">residencia</i>, was made to suffer for all the misdeeds of his
government (in reality that of the audiencia, Torralba being <i lang=
"es">decano</i>, 1715&ndash;1717), as well as for those of Bustamante
(1717&ndash;1719).</p>
<p>The audiencia, after it had been reconstituted by the
archbishop-governor, neglected to investigate the causes of the
governor&rsquo;s death, alleging as a reason that</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">this proceeding will greatly disturb the community;
that to proceed against these persons will be to cast odium on and
grieve nearly all the citizens, since the commotion was so general;
that all those who went out on that occasion did so &ldquo;in defense
of the ecclesiastical immunity, the preservation of this city, the
self-defense of its inhabitants, and the reputation of the [Spanish]
nation;&rdquo; and that to carry out this plan would be likely to cause
some disturbance of the public peace.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11537src" href="#xd21e11537" name="xd21e11537src">31</a></p>
</div>
<p>In a word, the influence of the archbishop was sufficient to keep
the audiencia from undertaking a formal investigation of the causes of
the governor&rsquo;s death. It was quite generally recognized that the
murder had been committed in the interests of the prelate, probably by
an assassin who had been in his pay, or in that of his friends, the
Jesuits. This is another illustration of the subserviency of the
audiencia to the governing power, on this occasion a churchman, who had
actively participated in the removal of his predecessor.</p>
<p>An interesting though ineffective protest was made by the audiencia
against the appointment of Jos&eacute; Basco y Vargas as Governor of
the Philippines in 1778. A communication was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>sent
to the court describing the abject state into which the king had
degraded the audiencia by subordinating it to a man whose title and
rank as <i>Captain of Frigate</i> gave him only the right to be
addressed as <i>You</i>, while each of the magistrates enjoyed the
title of <i>Lordship</i>. The Council rejected the complaint as an
absurdity, after which certain <i lang="es">oidores</i> conspired to
bring charges against Basco y Vargas, to arrest him and to make Sarrio
governor. The latter had been <i lang="la">ad interim</i> governor
after the death of Anda, and he was at that time the beneficiary of the
title and position of <i lang="es">segundo cabo</i>, or second in
command of the king&rsquo;s forces in the Islands. Sarrio refused to
join the magistrates in their revolt against the governor. Basco y
Vargas was informed of their treason, and it is significant that he
complied with the royal laws, not by attempting to punish the offenders
himself, but by sending the recalcitrant magistrates to Spain where
they were dealt with by the Council of the Indies.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e11565src" href="#xd21e11565" name="xd21e11565src">32</a></p>
<p>This was only a prelude to the discord which existed throughout the
administration of this able governor. The king was obliged to issue
special <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> on various occasions, ordering
a cessation of the perpetual discord.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11575src" href="#xd21e11575" name="xd21e11575src">33</a> Basco y
Vargas formed a society for the advancement of the economic interests
of the Islands,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11578src" href="#xd21e11578"
name="xd21e11578src">34</a> and in that, as well as in his successful
organization of the profitable tobacco monopoly, he was opposed by the
audiencia. The tribunal claimed that the governor was limiting its
sphere of authority in inaugurating these reforms.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e11586src" href="#xd21e11586" name="xd21e11586src">35</a> Basco
y Vargas recommended and brought about the separation of the
superintendency of <i lang="es">real hacienda</i> from the rest of the
government. This the audiencia also opposed, but in the contest
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>over jurisdiction which ensued between the
governor and the intendant, the governor and the audiencia acted in
complete harmony, because this new official threatened their mutual
interests and prerogatives.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11595src" href=
"#xd21e11595" name="xd21e11595src">36</a></p>
<p>Outlawry and highway robbery became so common throughout the Islands
during the term of Basco y Vargas that the governor appointed
prosecutors, sheriffs, and judges-extraordinary to assist in the
preservation of order, which the <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> were
not able to accomplish by themselves. The audiencia, feeling that this
was a grave intrusion upon its prerogatives, appealed to the king and
succeeded in bringing the sovereign displeasure upon the head of the
governor. The royal <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> stated that there
was no need of these additional officials. The judicial machinery which
had been provided for the Philippines from the beginning was
sufficient. The governor was warned, furthermore, to abstain from
meddling with the jurisdiction of the audiencia.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11608src" href="#xd21e11608" name="xd21e11608src">37</a> This
case confirms the statement already made in this treatise that during
this period and, in fact, after the establishment of the regency in
1776, the governor exercised a diminished authority in judicial
affairs. When Basco y Vargas took his office as governor of the
Philippine Islands, he was obliged to subscribe to two oaths, one as
governor, and the other as president of the audiencia, but he was
warned by a special decree of the king to keep from confusing these two
functions as former governors had done.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11611src" href="#xd21e11611" name="xd21e11611src">38</a></p>
<p>Many disagreements took place between the audiencia and Governor
Marquina, who succeeded Basco y Vargas. Marquina quarreled with the
audiencia over almost every act of government in which he had relations
with the tribunal. Marquina was said to have repeatedly disregarded the
<i lang="es">acuerdo</i> and to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283"
href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>have done as he pleased in
matters wherein the audiencia had been or should have been consulted.
There was a bitter contest in 1789, shortly after the arrival of this
governor, because he had excused various officials of <i lang="es">real
hacienda</i> from appearing when summoned to the audiencia to serve as
witnesses. Marquina did this, he claimed, because they were needed in
the provinces as financial agents, and because their absence from their
posts of duty would entail a grave loss to the government. The
audiencia solved the matter by forwarding all the correspondence
relative to these cases to the Council of the Indies. It may be said
that Marquina, in exempting these witnesses, was acting in his capacity
as president of the audiencia, but in his solicitude that no loss
should occur to the royal exchequer he was acting as superintendent of
<i lang="es">real hacienda</i>, which was within his
authority.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11627src" href="#xd21e11627"
name="xd21e11627src">39</a></p>
<p>In 1790 Marquina recommended the abolition of the audiencia on the
grounds that its continued presence constituted an obstruction to the
harmonious working of the machinery of government. He said that the
tribunal was a powerful weapon in the hands of men who used it for
their own personal advancement. In the place of an audiencia he
suggested the substitution of three <i lang="es">asesores</i>, one for
civil and criminal cases, one for <i lang="es">real hacienda</i>, and
another for commerce and the <i lang="es">consulado</i>. These <i lang=
"es">asesores</i> would have jurisdiction over the cases which
corresponded to these three departments. This scheme, he believed,
would effectively provide for all the judicial cases arising in the
Islands.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11645src" href="#xd21e11645" name=
"xd21e11645src">40</a> To this scheme, however, the Council paid no
heed.</p>
<p>Considerable attention has been given in another chapter to the
charges made by the audiencia against Marquina at the time of his
<i lang="es">residencia</i>. These complaints show that a state of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>continual disagreement had existed between these
two authorities throughout the entire term of the governor, and the
bringing of these charges was instrumental in making Marquina undergo a
very strict investigation. Personal jealousy was no small factor in
these continual recriminations. At no subsequent date, however, were
the large issues at stake which were characteristic of the struggle
between the audiencia and the governor at the time of Fajardo,
Curuzaelegui, and Bustamante. Those were death-struggles on the issue
of whether the audiencia should be an independent tribunal or whether
it should be subservient and subject to the governor. During those
struggles the tribunal was momentarily suppressed, or converted into an
instrument, in the hands of the governor. But these were exceptional
cases, and during the greater part of the long period of three hundred
years the relations between the audiencia and the executive were not so
discordant as they would seem to have been, judging by the instances
cited in this chapter. The audiencia, on all occasions of dispute with
the governor, was able to offer a formidable resistance to his
so-called encroachments on the prerogatives of the tribunal. Although
the governor, on most of the occasions noted above, occupied the
stronger position, owing to his more recent instructions, the support
given to him by the church, and his control of the <i lang=
"es">residencias</i> of the magistrates, nevertheless it may be said
that either authority was sufficiently powerful and independent to be
respected as an antagonist by the other, and each was indispensable to
the other.</p>
<p>These disagreements have been discussed in the foregoing pages
largely from the view-point of the audiencia. Practically all the
charges and complaints which have been cited were made in behalf of the
audiencia, and these show the magistrates in almost all cases to have
been acting in defense of their rights against usurpation and tyranny.
Fairness demands, however, that the other side should be presented in
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>same manner.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11665src" href="#xd21e11665" name="xd21e11665src">41</a>
Reference will now be made to a few of the many memorials heretofore
unquoted, which were sent by various governors in protest against the
alleged excesses of the audiencia.</p>
<p>As a first instance we may note the criticisms which Governor
G&oacute;mez P&eacute;rez Dasmari&ntilde;as made of the first audiencia
which served from 1584 to 1589. We shall also consider the complaints
which Dasmari&ntilde;as made against Pedro de Rojas, former <i lang=
"es">oidor</i> and later <i lang="es">teniente</i> and <i lang=
"es">asesor</i> of that governor (1589&ndash;1593). Dasmari&ntilde;as
came to the colony shortly after the first audiencia had been
suppressed and from his correspondence one may estimate the prevailing
opinion of the tribunal which had been recently removed. The governor
wrote as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">As the royal Audiencia was here so haughty and
domineering, he (Pedro de Rojas) retains that authority and harshness,
with which he tries to reduce all others as his vassals. In the matters
of justice that he discusses, he is unable to be impartial, but is in
many matters very biased. This is because of his trading and
trafficking, which the president and all the auditors (<i lang=
"es">oidores</i>) carried on from the time of their arrival&mdash;and
with so great avidity, trying to secure it all to themselves, that I
find no rich men here beside them. This is the reason why Rojas ... and
the auditors opposed the pancada in order that the consignments of
money sent by them to China might not be known&mdash;which, at last,
have come to light.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11685src" href=
"#xd21e11685" name="xd21e11685src">42</a></p>
</div>
<p>The governor charged the audiencia, moreover, with having opposed
the three per cent tax levied for the construction of the city wall.
Indeed, he accused the magistrates of having influenced the friars to
oppose all his acts as governor. He referred to the commercial excesses
of the <i lang="es">oidores</i>, saying: &ldquo;If the matter of
inspection and the residencia held here had fallen to my order and
commission, as it fell to that of the Viceroy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>of
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, I would have proved to your Majesty the
investments of past years.&rdquo; He concluded with the statement that
Rojas had been so busy with gain that he had been unable to attend to
his other duties; he was &ldquo;puffed up with the authority and name
of auditor&rdquo; (<i>i. e.</i>, <i lang="es">oidor</i>). He protested
against the transfer of Rojas to an office in Mexico,
&ldquo;for,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;such men go delighted with their
interests and gains from trade here, they are fettered and biased by
their relations with the trade of this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus we see that even this early in the history of the Islands, the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> as well as the governors were accused of a
predominating interest in commercial affairs.</p>
<p>Governor Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a recommended the suppression of the
audiencia in 1604, although he said that he had had no serious trouble
with that tribunal. His chief reason in favoring its removal was that
an appreciable saving would be realized thereby. The audiencia was,
moreover, very unpopular in Manila. He alleged that the name of
<i lang="es">oidor</i> was so odious that it was in itself an offense.
He stated that affairs had come to such a pass that</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">because I, in conformity to what your Majesty has
ordered, have attempted to maintain and have maintained amicable
relations with the auditors; and have shown, on various occasions, more
patience and endurance than the people considered right; and more than
seemed fitting to my situation, in order not to give rise to scandal;
some have conceived hatred for me, publicly saying that ... I was
neglecting to look after them, and that I could correct the evil which
the Audiencia was doing. But as I cannot do that, it has seemed to me
the best means to let the public see that there was good feeling
between me and the Audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11714src"
href="#xd21e11714" name="xd21e11714src">43</a></p>
</div>
<p>Here we have the case of a governor, who, in order to get along in
harmony with a quarrelsome and unpopular audiencia, gave way to it on
many occasions, and even incurred the displeasure of the residents of
the colony on account of what <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287"
href="#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span>seemed to them to be the
governor&rsquo;s easy-going attitude. His zeal for the king&rsquo;s
service, as he expressed it, moved him to recommend the abolition of
the tribunal. He said that the audiencia would not be missed if it were
removed, since there were only twelve hundred residents in the colony
and there were few cases to be tried. Most of the suits arising in the
Islands could be adjudicated by the <i lang="es">alcaldes
ordinarios</i> and appeals could be sent to Mexico. The <i lang=
"es">acuerdo</i>, or administrative session, Acu&ntilde;a alleged,
existed in name only.</p>
<p>Acu&ntilde;a made practically the same charges that have been so
often repeated already in this chapter. The magistrates had interfered
in the appointment of officials, which the governor claimed as his sole
prerogative. Each magistrate was accompanied on his journey to the
Islands by a vast company of relatives and dependents, who came to get
rich. These persons ultimately monopolized all the offices.
Notwithstanding the king&rsquo;s orders which forbade that offices
should be held by relatives of <i lang="es">oidores</i>, the governor
was placed in such a position that if he did not allow these persons to
hold office, the magistrates would take revenge by opposing him at
every turn, thus ruining the success of his administration.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e11732src" href="#xd21e11732" name=
"xd21e11732src">44</a> The same was true of trade, for these relatives
had to live, and if the government could not support them, they had to
be assigned privileges and advantages in trade, which the <i lang=

guarantee.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11744src" href="#xd21e11744"

"#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span></p>
<p>In view of all these abuses and evils which, directly or indirectly,
proceeded from the audiencia, Acu&ntilde;a maintained that all the
powers of government, war and justice, should be concentrated in the
office of governor and captain-general. The country, he said, was more
at war than at peace. It was essentially military, by virtue of its
location and isolation. Acu&ntilde;a contended that all authorities and
departments of the government should therefore be dependent on a
<span class="corr" id="xd21e11761" title=
"Source: miliary">military</span> chief rather than on a high court of
justice which was out of sympathy with the spirit and needs of the
colony. In a government so new as that of the Philippines, the same
laws and punishments should not be enforced so rigidly as in more
settled parts, yet the magistrates of the audiencia had failed to
understand that their functions in a colony of this character should be
in any way different than those of a similar tribunal in Spain.
Acu&ntilde;a stated that there had been occasions in which the
audiencia, in possession of partial evidence in regard to a military
matter, had interfered with an action which the governor had wished to
take. He had thus been rendered powerless to exercise sovereignty which
rightfully belonged to him, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href=
"#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>and which, if put into effect,
would no doubt have been for the best interests of the colony.</p>
<p>In addition to the above representations, the governor laid great
stress on the financial advantages which would be derived from a
suppression of the tribunal. He stated that the colony was short of
money, a condition of which the magistrates were well aware, yet they
always insisted on being the first to collect their own salaries, to
the exclusion, if necessary, of all other officials in the
colony.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11768src" href="#xd21e11768" name=
"xd21e11768src">46</a> With the money saved from the abolition of the
audiencia, an armed fleet could be provided for the defense of the
Islands. This was badly needed, and there was no other way of obtaining
the necessary ships. The Chinese rebellion of the year before<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e11780src" href="#xd21e11780" name=
"xd21e11780src">47</a> had caused a diminution of 46,000 pesos in the
commercial duties collected,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11786src" href=
"#xd21e11786" name="xd21e11786src">48</a> and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>consequent shortage of money in the treasury of
the colony furnished further reasons for the dismissal of this useless
and burdensome tribunal. Acu&ntilde;a admitted that the institution of
the audiencia might be successful in larger dependencies of Spain,
where the people were prosperous and where the government had an
assured income, but in the Philippines, where the citizens were poor,
with scarcely any means of support, and harassed by many magistrates
and their dependents, the audiencia had been a failure and a serious
burden.</p>
<p>Acu&ntilde;a&rsquo;s concluding statement very aptly sizes up the
situation and voices his demand for the abolition of the tribunal. He
wrote:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The difficulty which presents itself to me in this
matter is that, if the Audiencia is abolished and everything left in
charge of the governor, there will be but slow and poor remedy for the
grievances and disorders which may occur. For they must be taken to the
Audiencia of Mexico, which is so far away that the aggrieved ones would
consume both life and property before the business was settled ... all
say that they consider government by one person the best, when he
governs justly. These men (who believe in the above) know what the
governor can do without the Audiencia, and with it; and they believe
that it is better when there are not so many to command them, for they
have never seen the audiencias redress illegal acts by the
governors.... Although there is no doubt that much of what this paper
recounts occurs in other regions where there are audiencias, it must be
remembered that in this country, which is the newest of all and more
engaged in war than any of the others; and where the hardships of
conquest and maintenance are so omnipresent; and your Majesty has
little profit or advantage, except the cargo of cloth which goes to
Nueva Hespa&ntilde;a (<i>sic</i>), and which is divided among all; and
as the resources of the country are so scant that there is no place to
go in order to seek a livelihood outside of Manila: there is much
criticism in this matter, and the people are much aggrieved at seeing
themselves in the utmost part of the world, harassed and troubled by so
many magistrates and officers and their dependents, and at having so
many to satisfy; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291"
name="pb291">291</a>]</span>that matters are in such a state that he
who has an auditor for a protector may, it appears, go wherever he
wishes and with as much as he wishes, and he who has not must be
ruined.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11810src" href="#xd21e11810" name=

</div>
<p>This brings us to the administration of Governor Alonso Fajardo
(1618&ndash;1624), whose relations with the audiencia we have already
shown to have been very unpleasant. Fully as many charges were brought
against the <i lang="es">oidores</i> by that governor as were put
forward by the magistrates against him. According to Fajardo, the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> had so used their power of appointment that it
amounted to virtual dictation. Fajardo, like Acu&ntilde;a, found his
control over the filling of offices greatly diminished. He
energetically protested against the proposition which had been made to
increase the size of the court from four to five magistrates. He stated
that the amount of legal business which came before the tribunal did
not justify an augmentation of the number of <i lang="es">oidores</i>;
he recommended that the magistrates should spend their time more
advantageously, and waste less in quarreling among themselves and in
wreaking their passions on their rivals. Like Acu&ntilde;a, Fajardo
complained against the presence of so large a number of relatives and
personal followers of the <i lang="es">oidores</i>, whose lust for
office had to be satisfied.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11827src" href=
"#xd21e11827" name="xd21e11827src">50</a> The magistrates had engaged
in trade through intermediaries, and had spent the time which should
have been devoted to the administration of justice in devising schemes
whereby they and their agents could get the most out of forbidden
commercial transactions, and at the same time be protected in their
illicit activities. Fajardo claimed that the magistrates <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>had
abused their positions to such an extent that they had become an
intolerable incumbrance to the colony.</p>
<p>Strife and discord between the audiencia and the governor were
perhaps more bitter during the administration of Fajardo than at any
other time in the history of the Islands. This governor accused the
magistrates of deliberately attempting in all petty and inconsequential
ways to harass him into compliance with its desires. He wrote that he
had done everything possible to keep peace with the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i>, even at a sacrifice of the respect of the other
elements of the colony.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11838src" href=
"#xd21e11838" name="xd21e11838src">51</a> This testimony is practically
identical with that submitted by Governor Acu&ntilde;a in 1604. The
influence of the tribunal in the matter of appointments, judging by
this and by other statements and allegations already quoted, and by the
laws themselves, must have been great.</p>
<p>The tendency to fill offices with friends and relatives was
characteristic not only of the magistrates, but of the viceroys and
governors as well. More laws are to be found in the <i lang=
"es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i> which guard against such abuses by
governors and viceroys than by the magistrates of the
audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11846src" href="#xd21e11846"
name="xd21e11846src">52</a> Bearing in mind, of course, that there are
two sides to the question, it is at least clear that the audiencia was
successful in one of the purposes for which it was
created&mdash;namely, that of preventing the governor from exercising
entire control over appointments. We have the confession of Governor
Fajardo here and of Governor Acu&ntilde;a in the preceding paragraphs
that those governors were unable to prevent the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> from filling offices <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb293" href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>with their own
friends. Although we have been following the governor&rsquo;s side of
the question in these last few pages, we have noted in the preceding
chapter that the laws of the Indies gave to the audiencia the right of
participating in <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> with the governor in matters
of appointment.</p>
<p>Governor Fajardo&rsquo;s method of referring matters to the
audiencia for advice is interesting. Instead of submitting questions to
the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> for the general advice and opinion of all
the <i lang="es">oidores</i>, he was said to have sought to escape the
obligation of acting in accordance with the advice given him, by asking
the <i lang="es">oidores</i> for their individual opinions concerning
matters on which he desired advice. The audiencia took exception to
this method of procedure, alleging that he was thus escaping the
responsibilities of the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i>. Fajardo defended
himself against the accusation by the statement that the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> met together so seldom that he had been unable to
submit questions to the magistrates collectively in accordance with the
law.</p>
<p>Fajardo also complained against the failure of the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> to comply with his instructions in regard to the
inspection of the provinces. He stated that the magistrates disliked to
bestir themselves from their inactive and indolent lives amid the
comforts of Manila, and no inspections had been made during the three
years prior to the date of this letter. Philip III, without raising his
voice in indignation or decreeing any punishment upon those officials
who had refused to execute his decrees, mildly solicited that they
should devote their care and attention to the matter in the future. He
remonstrated that this was the only way in which the facts relating to
the country and to the interests and needs of its people could be
ascertained.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">These inspections are very essential, since they are
based on the relief of miserable persons, and in no way can the
condition of affairs be fully ascertained unless by means of these
inspections; and the most advisable measures can hardly be well
understood, if the condition and facts of what ought to be remedied and
can be bettered are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294"
name="pb294">294</a>]</span>not known. Hence I again charge you to pay
especial attention to these inspections. The Audiencia is commanded to
observe the orders that you shall give in your capacity as president so
that each auditor, when it concerns him, may observe his obligations
and go out on the inspections.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11886src"
href="#xd21e11886" name="xd21e11886src">53</a></p>
</div>
<p>In reply to these observations, the Council ordered Fajardo to make
recommendations for the reform of the government, stating that such
suggestions as he would make would be duly considered and
observed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11891src" href="#xd21e11891" name=
"xd21e11891src">54</a></p>
<p>On his arrival in the Islands, Fajardo, as yet unfamiliar with the
duties and conditions of his office, expressed his unwillingness to
recommend the entire abolition of the audiencia, preferring to have
present a council which he could consult regarding the problems of his
new office. The tribunal in the Philippines was probably not so
important as were those in Spain, under the immediate supervision of
the king, &ldquo;where,&rdquo; as he expressed it,</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">one obtains strict justice, administered by upright
and holy men&mdash;the people here considering that those who are
farthest from meriting that name are those who are farthest from the
presence of your Majesty and your royal counselors.... In what pertains
to me, I do not petition you for anything in this matter, since in no
respect can it be ill for me to have someone to consult, and who will
relieve me in matters of justice.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11901src"
href="#xd21e11901" name="xd21e11901src">55</a></p>
</div>
<p>Fajardo&rsquo;s act in forming a new audiencia after he had
suppressed the real one shows that the audiencia was essential to him
in the two particulars mentioned by him in the above letter.</p>
<p>That his attitude towards this question was somewhat altered by
three years&rsquo; experience as governor of the Philippines is shown
in his memorial of July 21, 1621. On this occasion Fajardo argued
against the continuation of the tribunal, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>showing himself to be
of the same opinion as Acu&ntilde;a, who, it will be remembered,
contended that because the colony was military in character, there
should be one person to control affairs, without any interference
whatsoever. He wrote:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">I beg your Majesty that while it shall last (the war)
you may be pleased to discontinue the Audiencia here, as it is this
that most hinders and opposes the administration and the government,
... This is the enemy which most afflicts this commonwealth, and most
causes dissensions, parties, factions, and hatred between the
citizens&mdash;each auditor persecuting those citizens who are not
wholly of his own faction, especially those who extend aid and
good-will toward the governor, against whom, as it seems, they show
themselves always in league. They always make declarations of
grievances [against him] because they are not each one given, as used
to be and is the custom here, whatever they may ask for their sons,
relatives and servants; and they habitually discredit the governor by
launching through secret channels false and malicious reports, and
afterward securing witnesses of their publicity. They even, as I have
written to your Majesty, manage to have religious and preachers publish
these reports to which end, and for his own security, each one of the
auditors has formed an alliance with the religious order which receives
him best.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11913src" href="#xd21e11913" name=
"xd21e11913src">56</a></p>
</div>
<p>He summarized as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">I consider this government much more difficult, with
the auditors of this Audiencia, than it is or would be even if there
were more war, for that war which they cause within its boundaries
appears beyond remedy, on account of their abilities and rank.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e11921src" href="#xd21e11921" name=
"xd21e11921src">57</a></p>
</div>
<p>An abundance of evidence exists on both sides of this controversy;
letters of complaint against the governor and charges against the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> by the governor. The vividness and apparent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span>directness of the charges and the apparent
sincerity of both the governor and the <i lang="es">oidores</i> make it
extremely difficult, and, in fact, quite impossible to decide on the
basis of the evidence presented, who was right or wrong, which charges,
true or untrue, and who was really responsible for the difficulties. It
would appear that the king was prone to sympathize with the governor
rather than with the audiencia, for in practically all cases the
decision of the sovereign was adverse to the tribunal. The fact that
the governor was the royal representative was probably a large factor
in securing him the support of the home government. Yet, on the other
hand, the audiencia was in the same sense the royal tribunal.</p>
<p>Governor Fajardo affords an example of a successful military man
who, having won fame for himself in the wars of the continent, but
without legal knowledge or administrative experience, was called to the
government of a distant and isolated colony, with the responsibility of
continuing in harmonious relations with a hostile civil and judicial
tribunal on the one hand, with whose powers and functions he was not
familiar, and an equally hostile religious institution on the other.
Men of military training usually had great contempt for the abilities
and good intentions of priests and lawyers in those days, and it was
frequently evident, both by their actions and by their own confessions,
that <i lang="es">conquistadores</i> of the stamp of Fajardo,
Acu&ntilde;a, and Corcuera were little fitted for the exercise of
administrative and governmental functions, however useful they might be
in adding to the domain of the Spanish empire.</p>
<p>Thus, there being present in the colony a tribunal of trained
lawyers who were at the same time capable and experienced
administrators, the governors became accustomed to rely on them for
advice and assistance, in compliance with the commands of the laws of
the Indies. As one governor of military tastes and training succeeded
another, each lacking administrative ability and experience, the
audiencia came to assume an increased <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb297" href="#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>share in the
governmental activity of the colony. This tendency was accentuated by
the fact that the governor was absent from the capital city on
campaigns of conquest and defense a large share of his time. Ability as
a soldier and commander was always the chief criterion for the
selection of a governor and captain-general, and military affairs were
given more attention by far than matters of administration.
Spain&rsquo;s policy of selecting soldiers instead of administrators
for the post of governor went far towards making the audiencia more
than a court of justice, and towards giving it a share in the executive
functions of government. This tendency was also furthered by the fact
that the audiencia came to assume the entire administration on the
death or absence of the governor, a power which it did not always
exercise well, but which it always relinquished with reluctance.</p>
<p>The Salcedo affair in 1668&ndash;1670 emphasizes other differences
than those of the audiencia and the governor, yet reference should be
made to it in this connection, because, after all, the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> were concerned indirectly in the struggle. An
examination of the data at our command will reveal the fact that the
refusal or failure of the <i lang="es">oidores</i> to intervene in
behalf of the governor led to his defeat and humiliation by the
commissary of the Inquisition. The audiencia might have prevented that
disaster had the magistrates been so inclined.</p>
<p>Before Governor Salcedo was arrested, imprisoned and sent to Mexico
in 1668 by the commissary of the Inquisition on charges of a purely
ecclesiastical character, the two <i lang="es">oidores</i>,
B&oacute;nifaz and Montemayor, were consulted by the enemies of the
governor as to the legality of the proposed action. There is every
reason to believe that the entire plot was worked out beforehand with
the fore-knowledge and consent of the <i lang="es">oidores</i>.
Inharmonious relations had existed before the arrest of the governor
between Salcedo and his associates, because of his independence and his
unwillingness to provide offices and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb298" href="#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span>opportunities for
commercial profit for their relatives. The exact part which the
audiencia played in the arrest of Salcedo is not known, since the
entire plot was schemed and executed under the cloak of the
Inquisition; but the fact remains that Oidores Montemayor and
B&oacute;nifaz each hoped to assume the management of governmental
affairs upon the exile of Salcedo. Indeed, the ambitions of
B&oacute;nifaz were realized. The removal of Salcedo culminated in the
usurpation of the government by B&oacute;nifaz, in the exile of
Montemayor, his rival, to the provinces, and in the complete
suppression of the audiencia for a year. It is said that
B&oacute;nifaz, through a usurper, ruled beneficently and well, and
that he little deserved the sentence of death which was pronounced on
him by the Council of the Indies. The authority for the assertion that
his rule was meritorious was ecclesiastical and hence, in this case,
possibly questionable.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11967src" href=
"#xd21e11967" name="xd21e11967src">58</a> It is certain, at least, that
B&oacute;nifaz and his government were under the complete domination of
the church.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11982src" href="#xd21e11982"
name="xd21e11982src">59</a></p>
<p>It has been frequently stated in this chapter, that jealousy and
rivalry were always determining factors in the relationship of the
audiencia and the governor. A new executive, until familiar with the
duties of his station, was always glad to seek the advice and
assistance of the <i lang="es">oidores</i>, meanwhile permitting the
audiencia to assume many functions which belonged to him as governor. A
new governor was gracious, and agreeable to all, and we find that most
of the favorable comments made concerning governors by magistrates,
prelates, and officials were pronounced when the environment was new to
them or to the governor. When the routine of official duties became
irksome <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span>and opportunities for private profit presented
themselves, as always happened in the course of time, friction arose,
and jealousy and discord took the place of the goodwill and harmony
which at first seemed so promising.</p>
<p>The most contaminating influence in the colony was the commercial
spirit. Governors and magistrates engaged in trade on a large scale,
and the churchmen also yielded to the commercial instinct. The latter
assertion will be enlarged upon in its proper place; proof of the
commercial activities of governors and magistrates has already been
given. The resentment of the <i lang="es">oidores</i> always led them
to place every conceivable opposition in the way of the governor when
it was seen that he was obtaining more than his fair share of profit
from trade, appointments, or indulgences to the Chinese. This led to a
refusal to ratify his appointments in many cases, to oppose him in the
<i lang="es">acuerdo</i>, to incite the residents of the colony against
him, and to do everything possible to make a failure of his
administration. Governors on the other hand might employ one of two
methods in dealing with the magistrates. That most commonly pursued was
to allow them a liberal share of the booty, commercial or political,
the latter obtained by permitting them to disregard the law by giving
offices to their relatives and followers, thereby purchasing their
favor. The other method was to meet their charges with counter-charges,
which were probably as truthful, though usually not so serious as those
which the magistrates made against them. The administrations of those
governors who openly opposed the audiencia and sought to keep it within
the limits of its jurisdiction as a judicial tribunal, were most
notable for their conflicts.</p>
<p>The Court of Madrid was unable to remedy these defects in colonial
administration. It could and did discipline the officials by sending an
occasional visitor, or by forcing them to give vigorous <i lang=
"es">residencias</i>, but these punishments only led to greater abuses
in order to reimburse themselves for the fines <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>which they had to pay. Officials were able to
send away large sums of money and consignments of merchandise, and
then, after having paid liberal penalties, they returned to Spain and
lived in comfortable retirement. Acceptance of the office of governor,
<i lang="es">oidor</i>, <i lang="es">corregidor</i>, or <i lang=
"es">alcalde mayor</i> was made with a foreknowledge that disputes
would arise, enemies would bring accusations, and punishments would be
meted out, whether deserved or not. This condition led to the abuses
which have been noted, and the recriminations and struggles between
authorities. From the view-point of these officials the Philippines
were neither governed for the good of the natives nor for the
residents, nor for the honor of Spain, nor for the propagation of the
Catholic religion, but merely for the profit and advancement of those
who were on the ground to take advantage of their opportunities. They
were struggles for profit; pure and simple contests between the
officials either to get all the proceeds possible from their offices or
to keep other officials from getting all, and thus to get a share for
themselves. There were exceptions, of course, to the conditions and
circumstances just noted. Some able and well-intentioned men came to
the Islands, as came to all of Spain&rsquo;s colonies, among whom may
be mentioned Oidor Antonio de Morga, the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>,
Francisco Leandro de Viana, and Governors Anda y Salazar, Basco y
Vargas, Aguilar, Enrile, and others of the nineteenth century when
opportunities for gain were somewhat diminished. Some of these
officials erred on the side of over-strictness, and their efforts to
restrain the avarice of their colleagues and to infuse the spirit of
<span class="corr" id="xd21e12020" title=
"Source: honestly">honesty</span> into their administrations united the
opposition and led to battles as violent and unrelenting as those which
were fought when all parties were dishonest.</p>
<p>In a chapter which deals alone with the conflicts of jurisdiction
which occurred between the governor and the audiencia, it would be
possible to arrive at an entirely mistaken conclusion. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name=
"pb301">301</a>]</span>Disagreements and differences were frequent as
well as pronounced, yet the history of the Philippines throughout the
three hundred years of Spanish rule is not a record of perpetual
strife. It is, of course, understood that no effort has been made in
this chapter to describe all the struggles which occurred in the
Islands between the audiencia and the governor. Those which have been
reviewed were selected for the purpose because they illustrate, in a
general way, the subjects over which disagreements arose, and the
principles underlying them.</p>
<p>We have noted, in general, that the audiencia exercised functions
and prerogatives which were not conferred upon it by the laws of the
Indies. The type of men who were appointed to the office of governor
and captain-general made inevitable the accretion of power in the hands
of the magistrates. The audiencia gradually came to assume more
attributes than the solely judicial ones. Necessity compelled the
governor in many instances to entrust the tribunal with many of his own
functions because of his lack of skill and experience as an
administrator or on account of his devotion to military affairs. In
these ways the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> came to be legislative as well
as advisory; the frequent absence of the governor, or his death, led to
the audiencia&rsquo;s assumption of the governorship and the tribunal
was always reluctant to surrender the administrative powers once
gained.</p>
<p>Jealousy between officials and the resultant conflicts of authority
may be classified together as a cause of strife. These difficulties
resulted in part from the fact that the sphere of authority of each
official was not defined with exactness in the laws of the Indies, and
also because those laws were often countermanded by later <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dulas</i> of whose existence the colonial officials were
not always aware. Spanish laws were frequently repealed and
subsequently put in force without notice; this was always a source of
confusion. Then again the exceptional <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb302" href="#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>opportunities for
trade offered by the transfer of the rich oriental cargoes at Manila
tempted <i lang="es">oidores</i> and governors alike. The trading
privileges conceded by the government did not always end when the limit
of permission was reached. Some officials, and particularly governors,
could command more than their rightful share of galleon space; this led
to disputes and recriminations which often interfered seriously with
the government. We have noted that the appointing power which belonged
nominally to the governor and which was shared by the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> was also a source of much trouble. The knowledge that
the <i lang="es">residencia</i> would ultimately bring about the
punishment of guilty officials and enemies, the distance and isolation
of the colony, and the length of time necessary for
communication&mdash;all these factors made it possible for officials to
commit excesses. Another cause of discord was what might be termed the
reaction of the executive against the increased power and authority of
the audiencia. This accretion of power was due to the complete
dependence of the governor on the tribunal in administrative matters,
especially at the <span class="corr" id="xd21e12049" title=
"Source: begining">beginning</span> of his term, the increasing power
of the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i>, the superiority of the audiencia as a
court of appeals from the decisions of the governor, and the fact that
the latter always needed the presence of the audiencia to lend legality
to his government.</p>
<p>It may be stated, nevertheless, that the governor actually held the
more powerful position in the colony, and that he most frequently
emerged victor in the various struggles with the audiencia. Various
reasons may be assigned for this. The governor was the personal
representative of the king, and in this capacity he had the backing of
the home government. He commanded the military forces in the colony.
The authority of the royal patronage was vested in the governor; he was
thus often able to command the support of the church and clergy in his
struggles with the audiencia. The authority over the disposal of
offices, either by sale or appointment belonged <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>legally to the governor, although this power was
effectively disputed and often shared by the audiencia. The governor
employed the last-mentioned power on some occasions to the extent of
reforming and reconstituting the audiencia, thus making the government
entirely dependent on him. A new governor always carried with him a
more recent appointment than those of the <i lang="es">oidores</i> whom
he found in the colony, and aside from this he usually possessed
definite instructions embodying the royal will on all current issues.
The control of the <i lang="es">residencias</i> of the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> was usually in the hands of the governor, and lastly,
the <i lang="fr">laissez faire</i> attitude of the Spanish government,
its extreme conservatism, and its apparent reluctance to correct the
evils and abuses which were reported to it&mdash;all these were potent
factors in leaving the balance of power as it had been, in the hands of
the governor, notwithstanding the presence of the audiencia.</p>
<p>A previously quoted statement made by a famous British historian in
his description of the relative powers of the viceroys of New Spain,
and Per&uacute;, and their respective audiencias, may be used here,
with equal effect, to characterize the situation in the Philippines,
and to summarize this part of our discussion: &ldquo;They (the
magistrates of the audiencia) may advise, they may remonstrate; but in
the event of a direct collision between their opinion and the will of
the viceroy (governor), what he determines must be brought into
execution, and nothing remains for them but to lay the matter before
the king and the Council of the Indies.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

Chapter II, notes 61 and 64 of this book. The study which Dr. David P.
Barrows has recently made of the office of governor and captain-general
is of value in showing the continuity, and at the same time the
evolution of the office from Spanish times to the present. Dr. Barrows
states that Miguel L&oacute;pez de Legaspi became governor and
captain-general of the Philippines when the office was created in 1567.
The original <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of establishment and
appointment is in Blair and Robertson, III, 62&ndash;66, and bears the
date of August 14, 1569. See Barrows, &ldquo;The governor-general of

Torralba to the King, June 23, 1718, A. I., 68&ndash;4&ndash;18. When
Governor Bustamante arrived in Manila in 1717, Torralba&rsquo;s
services as <i lang="es">oidor</i> and temporary governor, extending
over a period of eight years, were investigated. Wholesale bribery was
the leading charge against him. He had levied blackmail on <i lang=
"es">alcaldes mayores</i>, <i lang="es">encomenderos</i>, and Chinese
and Spanish merchants. He was also charged with the misuse of
government funds, and was held responsible for large deficits. It was
said that he had sent his wife to Macao with most of this ill-gotten
money. In his <i lang="es">residencia</i> he was fined 120,000 pesos,
exiled forever from Madrid, Manila and New Spain, and was reduced
subsequently to such poverty that he was compelled to beg. He died a
pauper in the hospital of San Juan de Di&oacute;s, in Cavite, in
1736.</p>

Diego de Otazo, the Jesuit confessor of Bustamante, in a letter to his
superior, described the power of the governor and his treatment of the
audiencia as follows: &ldquo;Here, my father,&rdquo; he wrote,
&ldquo;the governor takes away and establishes, gives, commands,
unmakes and makes more despotically than does the king himself;...
Royal decrees are not sufficient; for either he hides them, or he does
not fulfill them as he ought. The Audiencia does not serve [as a check]
on him, for he suppresses and he establishes it, when and how he
pleases; nor do other bodies, whether chapters or [religious]
communities (dare to oppose him), ... for he does the same thing [with
them]. And never do there lack pretexts for doing thus, even though
such bodies are appointed by the king; and with the pretext that
account of the matter has already been rendered to Madrid, what he has
begun remains permanently done, or else he proceeds to change it, as
seems good to him.&rdquo; (Letter of Diego de Otazo, S. J., November
19, 1719, Blair and Robertson, XLIV, 175.)</p>

Acu&ntilde;a continued as follows: &ldquo;If the governors do not
consent to this (the appointment of the relatives and dependents of
<i lang="es">oidores</i>), the auditors dislike them, and seek means
and expedients whereby the worthy persons to whom the said offices and
livings are given shall not be received therein. Accordingly the
governors, in order not to displease the auditors, give up their claims
and dare not insist upon them&rdquo; (<i>ibid.</i>, 234).</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11744" href="#xd21e11744src" name="xd21e11744">45</a></span>
Acu&ntilde;a further commented on their commercial abuses: &ldquo;The
said creatures and connections of the said auditors trade and traffic a
great deal in merchandise from China; and the citizens complain that it
is with the auditors&rsquo; money (their own or borrowed), and that
with the favor they receive they cause great injury to the
commonwealth, for they take up the whole cargo. They desire to be
preferred therein, and in buying the cloth and in every other way, try
to take advantage. If the president wishes to remedy this they do not
cease to offer him little annoyances; for the auditors know how to
magnify themselves, in such a manner that they give one to understand
that any one of them is greater than he; and they attain this by saying
that what the president or governor does they can cancel, and that what
the auditors decree has no appeal, recourse, or redress&rdquo;
(<i>ibid.</i>, 234&ndash;5).</p>
<p class="footnote">Acu&ntilde;a testified that the magistrates had
rendered life unpleasant for the residents of the colony, because of
their selfishness. He continued: &ldquo;the resources of this land are
scanty, but if there is anything good the auditors also say that they
want it for themselves; and when there is a Chinese embroiderer,
tailor, carver, or other workman, they proceed to take him.... Such
benefits do not extend to the citizens; but rather, if any of these
things are available, the said auditors demand them and by entreaty and
intimidation get possession of them. It is the same thing in regard to
jewels, slave men and women, articles of dress, and other things.... We
are compelled to overlook these things, and others of more importance,
that we may not experience worse trouble; ... as your Majesty is five
thousand leguas from here and redress comes so slowly&rdquo;
(<i>ibid.</i>, 235&ndash;236).</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11768" href="#xd21e11768src" name="xd21e11768">46</a></span>
Their salaries must be preferred, he wrote, &ldquo;even if it be from
the stated fund for the religious orders, bishops, ministers of
instruction, and for the military forces, who are before them in
order,&mdash;they have difficulties and misunderstandings with the
royal officials (<i>ibid.</i>, 236) ... as the treasury is always
straitened (<i>sic</i>), and, on account of the great care which the
auditors take to collect their salaries, as it cannot be so prompt as
they would wish, they seek borrowed money from the citizens&mdash;who
give it to them, willingly or unwillingly, each one according to his
means or designs. From this follow difficulties, to which they pay no
heed; as some of them demand these loans from persons who are parties
to suits at the time, who grant these to the auditors in order to place
them under obligations, and profit by them&rdquo; (<i>ibid.</i>,
239).</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11780" href="#xd21e11780src" name="xd21e11780">47</a></span> The
rebellion referred to here occurred in 1603. It was said to have been
instigated by two mysterious mandarins who came to Manila for the
alleged purpose of searching for a mountain of silver, which was
located near Cavite. On the Eve of St. Francis the Chinese made their
attack with great success, owing, the ecclesiastical element claimed,
to the personal intervention of St. Francis, who appeared on the walls
and led his followers to victory. In this revolt 24,000 Chinese were
hunted down and slain. In 1639 another rebellion occurred. A third
insurrection of the Chinese took place in 1660. In 1763 the Chinese
joined with the British in their attack on the city. It is estimated
that Anda, in his campaign in the provinces, put an end to 6,000
Chinese. Another massacre, and the last in the history of the Islands,
took place in 1820. This was an uprising of the natives against all
foreigners who were thought to be responsible for the plague of cholera
then raging (Foreman, <i>Philippine Islands</i>, 108&ndash;119; A. I.,
105&ndash;1 to 10 and 68&ndash;1&ndash;27).</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11786" href="#xd21e11786src" name="xd21e11786">48</a></span> The
entire dependence of the colony on the Chinese trade is attested by
Concepci&oacute;n (<i lang="es">Historia general</i>, IV, 53). He
states that: &ldquo;Without the trade and commerce of the Chinese these
dominions could not have subsisted.&rdquo; Morga, in his <i lang=
"es">Sucesos</i> (349), further testifies: &ldquo;It is true the town
cannot exist without the Chinese, as they are the workers in all trades
and business, and are very industrious, working for small
wages.&rdquo;</p>

Fajardo described &ldquo;the oppression caused by the multitude of
relatives and followers (of the auditors); their appropriation of the
offices and emoluments, to the injury of the meritorious; their hatred
and hostility to those who unfortunately fall out with them; their
trading and trafficking, although it be by an intermediary, since they,
being men of influence, buy the goods at wholesale and protect their
agents.&rdquo; He stated that this caused him great embarrassment and
made good government almost an impossibility (Fajardo to Felipe III,

&ldquo;The auditors,&rdquo; Fajardo wrote, &ldquo;have few important
matters that oblige them to close application, (and) they must apply
the greater part of their time to devising petty tricks on the
president in order to vex and weary him, until, [as they hope] not only
will he allow them to live according to their own inclination but also
their relatives and followers shall, in whatever posts they desire, be
employed and profited. And since harmony has never been seen here
without this expedient, one would think it easy to believe such a
supposition&rdquo; (Fajardo to the King, August 15, 1620, Blair and

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE AUDIENCIA AND THE GOVERNOR: THE AD INTERIM
RULE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The most extensive non-judicial activity in which the
audiencia participated at any time was its assumption of the
provisional government of the colony during vacancies in the
governorship. Aside from the ten different occasions on which this was
done, the audiencia very frequently assumed control of the government
when the exigencies of defense and foreign conquest rendered necessary
the temporary absence of the governor. This was true at irregular
intervals during the administrations of Governors Pedro Bravo de
Acu&ntilde;a (1602&ndash;1606), Juan de Silva (1609&ndash;1616), Juan
Ni&ntilde;o de Tavora (1626&ndash;1632), Sebasti&aacute;n Hurtado de
Corcuera (1635&ndash;1644) and Diego Fajardo (1644&ndash;1653). The
administrations of these several governors were characterized by
extensive military operations, largely in a foreign field, and the
audiencia not only took over governmental affairs but it assumed the
obligations of defense during their absence. On such occasions, of
course, the tribunal retained its exercise of judicial functions.</p>
<p>Since the audiencias in Per&uacute; and New Spain assumed the
government much earlier than did the audiencia in the Philippines, and
as the laws authorizing the rule of the audiencia were promulgated
first to meet conditions in those viceroyalties, it seems advisable to
inquire into the circumstances surrounding the establishment and
development of this practice there. Having done this, we shall proceed
to a study of the <i lang="la">ad interim</i> rule of the Audiencia of
Manila, noting particularly the causes of the success or failure of its
administration and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305"
name="pb305">305</a>]</span>the effect of this practice upon the
subsequent relations of the audiencia and the governor.</p>
<p>The first law in the <i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>
authorizing the assumption of the government by an audiencia was
promulgated as early as March 19, 1550. This law provided that in case
of a vacancy in the office of Viceroy of Per&uacute;, the audiencia
there should succeed to the governments of Per&uacute;, Charcas, Quito
and Tierra Firme, and that the three last-named subordinate audiencias
should obey the mandates of the Audiencia of Lima until a permanent
successor to the viceroy was named.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12100src" href="#xd21e12100" name="xd21e12100src">1</a> This law
was proclaimed again on November 20, 1606.</p>
<p>Even before the promulgation of the above law the audiencias of Lima
and Mexico had assumed control of the government in their respective
viceroyalties. Shortly after the death of Francisco Pizarro, the
conqueror, an audiencia was sent to Per&uacute;, arriving at Lima in
January, 1544, in company with Blasco N&uacute;&ntilde;ez Vela, the
first viceroy. The rigidity and thoroughness with which this new
executive enforced the New Laws which were entrusted to him met with
the opposition of the residents of the colony, and the audiencia
accordingly removed him from his position as viceroy and suspended the
operation of the code referred to, assuming charge of affairs
itself.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12107src" href="#xd21e12107" name=
"xd21e12107src">2</a> Its rule was brief, however, for on October 28,
1544, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>it invited Gonzalo Pizarro, the brother of the
conqueror, into the city and turned the government over to him,
proclaiming him Governor and Captain-General of Per&uacute;.</p>
<p>During the period from 1544 to 1551, until the arrival in
Per&uacute; of Viceroy Mendoza, the audiencia exercised control of
governmental affairs. It made and unmade captains-general and viceroys,
irrespective of royal appointments. It suspended the New Laws of 1542
and its commands were obeyed. From 1550 to 1551 it governed alone. In
these incidents we note that the audiencia actually assumed the
government <i lang="la">ad interim</i> prior to the time of the
promulgation of the law of March 19, 1550, exercising administrative as
well as judicial powers, thirty-five years before the Audiencia of
Manila was created. &ldquo;To it (the audiencia) were confided in the
beginning and later in the absence of the viceroy,&rdquo; writes Moses,
&ldquo;all matters with which governmental authority might properly
deal.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12125src" href="#xd21e12125"
name="xd21e12125src">3</a> He further states that &ldquo;the audiencia
in its executive capacity, failed to justify the expectations of the
king, and a new order of things was introduced by the appointment of a
viceroy&rdquo; (Mendoza, April 17, 1535) for New Spain.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e12130src" href="#xd21e12130" name=
"xd21e12130src">4</a></p>
<p>These powers were not only exercised by the Audiencia of Lima, but
also by a second tribunal which was created in 1549 at Santa F&eacute;
de Bogot&aacute;. The latter body was endowed permanently with both
judicial and administrative powers, appealing important cases to the
superior government at Lima. This audiencia had the status of a
presidency. Its president was often captain-general, <i lang=
"es">visitador</i>, and senior magistrate, and in exercising the
functions of these various offices he was in all respects the most
powerful official in New Granada, always being able to enforce his will
over the other magistrates. At times this official acted with entire
independence of the Viceroy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href=
"#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>of Per&uacute;.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e12142src" href="#xd21e12142" name="xd21e12142src">5</a> The
exercise of military functions by this president and audiencia is
especially to be noticed in the part they played in putting down the
Pij&aacute;o Indian revolt in 1565.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12150src" href="#xd21e12150" name="xd21e12150src">6</a> On the
whole, however, judging by the strife prevailing in the colony, the
various struggles between the <i lang="es">oidores</i> and the
president, and between the audiencia or president and the archbishop,
the government could never have been considered successful. The
official corruption which became apparent as a result of the <i lang=
"es">pesquisas</i> and <i lang="es">residencias</i> held during the
rule of the Audiencia of Santa F&eacute; could scarcely have encouraged
the home government to entrust that tribunal with the administration of
affairs in the future.</p>
<p>The defects referred to above in connection with the government of
the Audiencia of Santa F&eacute; did not deter the Spanish crown from
founding the Audiencia of Charcas in 1559. This tribunal, &ldquo;like
the audiencias established elsewhere, exercised not only judicial, but
also administrative powers.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12167src"
href="#xd21e12167" name="xd21e12167src">7</a> It had jurisdiction over
the neighboring city of Potos&iacute;. Again we may note the case of
the Audiencia of Santiago de Chile, which was established on August 27,
1565. Its members arrived in 1567 and the audiencia was installed at
Concepci&oacute;n &ldquo;as the supreme court of the colony, and, at
the same time, in accordance with the royal decree, it became the
administrative head of the government. In this latter capacity it
undertook to reorganize the military forces.&rdquo; Later, in 1568,
Melchoir Bravo de Saravia assumed the office and functions of the
governorship of Chile (1568&ndash;1575) and the audiencia became a
judicial tribunal, without other attributes.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12172src" href="#xd21e12172" name="xd21e12172src">8</a></p>
<p>We may gather from these various citations taken from the early
history of the audiencias of South America that these tribunals not
only exercised the authority of governing <i lang="la">ad <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>interim</i>, but that they had permanent
governmental and administrative powers as well. It would seem, as
Professor Moses has suggested, that the original purpose of the Spanish
government had been to entrust the executive and administrative
functions in the dependencies to the audiencia, and that the endowment
of the viceroys and captains-general with extensive executive powers
was an expedient to which Spain was obliged to turn after the breakdown
of the audiencia as an administrative agency. The main fact to be
emphasized in this connection is that during the period of the
promulgation of the laws which we are now studying, the minor
audiencias were exercising regular governmental powers.</p>
<p>The Audiencia of Mexico, which was created in 1527 to check the
excesses of Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s, had participated in
governmental affairs even before the events described above. This
tribunal, which was composed of four magistrates, with the notorious
Guzm&aacute;n as president, conducted the <i lang="es">residencias</i>
of Cort&eacute;s and his followers, and after obtaining control of the
government, administered affairs to suit its own convenience.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e12189src" href="#xd21e12189" name=
"xd21e12189src">9</a> It was at this time, and as a result of these
abuses, Bancroft tells us, that the Spanish government decided to
establish a viceroyalty in New Spain, with a semiregal court and regal
pretensions. A new tribunal was left in charge of governmental affairs
while this reform was being inaugurated. This second audiencia governed
with great satisfaction, correcting the abuses of its predecessor and
devoting itself to various improvements.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12195src" href="#xd21e12195" name="xd21e12195src">10</a></p>
<p>Although the audiencia of 1528&ndash;1535 exercised the
administrative functions above mentioned, Bancroft brings forth no
evidence in support of the theory that it was ever the royal intention
to entrust the institution of the audiencia permanently with
administrative authority. He states that as early <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span>as
1530, three years after the establishment of the first tribunal in
Mexico, the sovereigns had already decided to establish a viceroyalty.
Although the audiencia was entrusted with the government for a few
years, the above facts would seem to indicate that this was only a
temporary arrangement. The audiencia&rsquo;s chief attributes were
judicial, and we have repeatedly noted that the principal object of its
establishment, aside from the administration of justice, was to check
the abuses of the captain-general.</p>
<p>Cort&eacute;s retained his rank as captain-general after the
audiencia was established. The conqueror was in reality reduced to a
secondary position, and he was compelled repeatedly to acknowledge the
supremacy of the audiencia. His commission was recognized by the
tribunal on its arrival, but soon after its establishment the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> exhibited a royal order requiring that
&ldquo;Cort&eacute;s, in all his operations, should consult the
president and <i lang="es">oidores</i> and act only on their
approval.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12213src" href=
"#xd21e12213" name="xd21e12213src">11</a> Even in his field, as
commander of the military forces, Cort&eacute;s was subordinated to the
tribunal, and the audiencia and the conqueror quarrelled bitterly over
practically all matters which presented themselves for solution. The
audiencia had been created to meet extraordinary and unusual
conditions. It was the business of the tribunal to correct the abuses
which had previously been inflicted on the colony by Cort&eacute;s, and
it did so. On the arrival of Mendoza in 1535, however, the audiencia
surrendered the control of administrative affairs, and it did not
assume them again, except in the regular way in conjunction with the
viceroy, until it next served to administer the <i lang="la">ad
interim</i> government.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12221src" href=
"#xd21e12221" name="xd21e12221src">12</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb310" href="#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span></p>
<p>The first legal provision for the succession of the audiencia in
Mexico, according to Bancroft, was contained in the royal instructions
to Visitor Valderrama, who arrived in Mexico in 1563. These
instructions, says Bancroft, provided that in the event of the death or
inability of the viceroy to discharge his duties, the audiencia should
rule temporarily.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12246src" href=
"#xd21e12246" name="xd21e12246src">13</a> This was indeed timely, in
view of the death of Viceroy Velasco on July 31, 1564. The audiencia,
which was legally authorized to take charge of the government, was
under investigation when the death of the viceroy occurred, and the
tribunal was dominated during the first half of its rule by the
visitor, who, Bancroft tells us, was virtually viceroy.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e12252src" href="#xd21e12252" name=
"xd21e12252src">14</a> Valderrama dismissed two of the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i>, and sent them to Spain. The audiencia was even less
able to administer justice during the early part of its <i lang="la">ad
interim</i> government than it had been when the viceroy was alive.
After the departure of the visitor, however, the audiencia inaugurated
a season of proscription and reprisal which bade fair to include every
opponent of the <i lang="es">oidores</i> in the colony. Matters had
reached a very unsatisfactory state, indeed, when the new viceroy, the
Marqu&eacute;s de Falc&eacute;s, arrived at Mexico on October 14,
1566.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12267src" href="#xd21e12267" name=
"xd21e12267src">15</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href=
"#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span></p>
<p>In view of the fact that the next important law dealing with the
question of the succession was not promulgated until 1600, a
continuance of this survey of affairs in New Spain will not be
necessary. The audiencia there did not again assume the government
until 1612, and then only for a very short period. We have already
noticed the conditions under which the Audiencia of Mexico was created,
and the various occasions on which it assumed charge of the government.
Though entrusted with the government upon its establishment, the
example set by three years of its unsatisfactory rule convinced the
Spanish monarch of the unwisdom of entrusting such governmental
authority to the audiencia permanently. Therefore, a viceroy was sent
out in 1535, and it was not until 1563 that the first law was
promulgated which provided for the temporary government by the
audiencia when there was a vacancy in the office of viceroy. This was
thirteen years after such a law had been promulgated for Per&uacute;,
and fourteen years after an audiencia had been created, with all the
functions of government, at Santa F&eacute; de Bogot&aacute;.</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of February 12, 1569, following
in sequence that of March 5, 1550, provided that the faculty of filling
vacancies among the <i lang="es">oficiales reales</i>, in case of death
or removal from office, should rest with the viceroy, president, or the
audiencia, if the latter body were governing.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12302src" href="#xd21e12302" name="xd21e12302src">16</a> This, of
course, was a recognition of the principle of the assumption of the
government by the audiencia. This law was not confined in its
application to any particular territory, but was general in its
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>scope and applicable wherever an audiencia
existed. It was later confirmed by the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i>
of August 24, 1619.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12313src" href=
"#xd21e12313" name="xd21e12313src">17</a></p>
<p>The next law dealing with the subject of succession was promulgated
on January 3, 1600. It applied especially to New Spain, and it provided
that in case of a vacancy in the office of viceroy, either by death or
by promotion, the audiencia should assume charge of the government of
the provinces there, and it should execute the duties which ordinarily
devolved upon the viceroy, performing them &ldquo;as he could, would
and ought to do.&rdquo; It furthermore ordered the subordinate
Audiencia of Guadalajara, under such circumstances, to obey and fulfill
the orders which the Audiencia of Mexico might give or send, in the
same manner as it would do, were those orders issued by the
viceroy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12320src" href="#xd21e12320" name=
"xd21e12320src">18</a> Under a separate title on this same date the
assumption of the government of the minor dependencies of Per&uacute;
and New Spain by the respective audiencias was authorized in case of
the illness or absence of the viceroy. In other words, this law
authorized in New Spain the same procedure in case of the death or
absence of the viceroy as had already prevailed in South America for
half a century.</p>
<p>The above laws form a precedent for the subsequent authorization of
the Audiencia of Manila to assume charge of the government on the death
of the governor. This authorization was given on April 12, 1664, but
the Audiencia of Manila, like those of Mexico and Lima, had already
assumed the functions of the executive on four earlier occasions, and
the king, in the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of 1664, merely
recognized, with some qualifications, a practice which had been
followed in the Philippines for half a century. A <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> dated as early as September 13, 1608, had
authorized the nomination in advance by the Viceroy of New Spain of a
resident of the Islands to assume the governorship <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>on
the death of the regular governor.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12335src"
href="#xd21e12335" name="xd21e12335src">19</a> The intention of this
law seems to have been to guard against the ills incident to a vacancy
in the governorship by an arrangement whereby some person should be
appointed in advance and thus be ready to assume the command without
delay. Whatever the royal intentions may have been, this law was never
effective in bringing about the benefits for which it was designed. In
fact, this particular provision met with general dissatisfaction in the
Philippines, and the audiencia, acting in accordance with the custom
observed in other parts of Spain&rsquo;s dominions, continued to govern
on the demise of the governor, ruling two or three years on some
occasions, until the arrival of a temporary governor, sent from New
Spain. So flagrantly was the prescribed method of procedure violated in
the Philippines that in 1630, Visitor Francisco de Rojas y Ornate
reminded the Council of the Indies of the existing law (that of 1608)
and recommended that henceforth on the death of a governor the
audiencia should have nothing to do with administration, but that one
of three persons secretly designated by the viceroy should take over
the government at once, thus eliminating all possibility of the
interference of the tribunal.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12347src"
href="#xd21e12347" name="xd21e12347src">20</a></p>
<p>The irregularities and inconveniences arising from the inefficacy of
the law of 1608 led to the promulgation of the <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dulas</i> of January 30, 1635, and of April 2, 1664, and
to the enactment of the <i lang="es">consulta</i> of September 9, 1669.
These regulations applied exclusively to the Philippines, and they
legalized the intervention of the audiencia in governmental affairs on
the death of the governor. The first of these admitted the right of the
audiencia to administer political affairs, but ordered that military
defense should be in the hands of a person <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314</a>]</span>appointed in advance by the Viceroy of New
Spain. The <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of April 2, 1664, ordered
that the audiencia should serve temporarily during vacancies in the
governorship until the temporary appointee of the viceroy should
arrive. This law further prescribed that the audiencia should assume
charge of political affairs while the senior magistrate should take
over the military command. He was to see that the forces and defenses
of the Islands were adequately kept up, and that the soldiers were
disciplined; he was authorized to command them in case of insurrection
or invasion. The <i lang="es">consulta</i> of September 9, 1669, above
referred to, re-enacted the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of April 2,
1664, but in addition it specifically ordered that the viceroy should
not designate a temporary governor until news of the death of the
regular incumbent was received, and then that no resident or native of
the Philippines should be appointed.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12375src" href="#xd21e12375" name="xd21e12375src">21</a></p>
<p>The Council of the Indies, by the law of September 29, 1623, had
already sought to guard against any undue assumption of power on the
part of the audiencia by ordering that when the viceroy was absent from
the capital city, but within his own district, he should still retain
his status as governor, and neither the audiencia nor any of the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> should interfere in governmental
affairs.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12389src" href="#xd21e12389" name=
"xd21e12389src">22</a> This law was not applicable to the Philippines
alone, but it was of general validity, throughout Spain&rsquo;s
dominions. The control of the audiencia in governmental affairs was
only to become effective when the governor was absent from the colony,
or incapacitated through sickness or death. Otherwise the
governor&rsquo;s sphere of authority was to be recognized by the
tribunal.</p>
<p>A variety of laws exist in the <i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>
prescribing the duties and conduct of the audiencia when it had charge
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>governmental affairs, and defining the
relationship which should exist between the <i lang="es">oidores</i>
under such conditions. The magistrates were ordered to proceed
harmoniously and moderately both in the execution of governmental
affairs and in the administration of justice, not erring either on the
side of excessive severity, or of undue moderation. They were to devote
special attention to the increase and care of the royal revenue during
these times.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12404src" href="#xd21e12404"
name="xd21e12404src">23</a> The right to grant <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i>, essentially the function of the governing
authority, was conceded to the audiencia when it acted in the capacity
of governor. All such concessions ultimately had to be confirmed by the
king. On these occasions, also, the audiencia filled vacancies and made
appointments. However, the <i lang="es">oidores</i> were warned against
discharging officials and vacating offices in order to fill them with
their dependents and friends.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12416src"
href="#xd21e12416" name="xd21e12416src">24</a> All appointments made by
the audiencia were to become void after the arrival of a regular
governor, unless they had subsequently received the royal confirmation.
When a vacancy arose, it was the duty of the senior magistrate to
propose a candidate, but the actual filling of the place was to be
effected by the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> vote of the entire
audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12424src" href="#xd21e12424"
name="xd21e12424src">25</a></p>
<p>The laws provided that the audiencia, as a body, should exercise two
distinct types or classes of powers when in charge of the government.
These were designated as governmental and military. The exercise of
these functions was assigned respectively to the audiencia as a body,
and to the senior magistrate, individually. While an effort was made to
insure the fair and equal participation of all in government in case of
a vacancy, the senior magistrate assumed the position and honors of the
executive, though not granted all the governor&rsquo;s powers.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e12431src" href="#xd21e12431" name=
"xd21e12431src">26</a> In the functions and duties of administration
all the magistrates were to participate. As noted above, each was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name=
"pb316">316</a>]</span>to have a share in the exercise of the
appointing power, the administration of colonial finances,
participation in the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i>, and in every other
function except defense, which was entrusted to the senior <i lang=
"es">oidor</i>. In this capacity, the <i lang="es">oidor</i> was always
the most prominent figure in the government. Among those who
distinguished themselves through the exercise of this power were Rojas,
Morga, Alcaraz, B&oacute;nifaz, Coloma, Montemayor, and above all,
Anda. Although these men were assisted and supported by their
colleagues of the audiencia, and the parts played by the latter were
not without importance, the periods of rule of the audiencia are always
identified with the names of the senior <i lang="es">oidores</i>, while
those of the ordinary magistrates are forgotten.</p>
<p>A complete understanding of the governmental functions and authority
of the audiencia, and the relation of the latter to the other
departments of government under these conditions may best be obtained
by a review of the circumstances and conditions of the
audiencia&rsquo;s rule during vacancies in the Philippines. The first
occasion which in any way approached the temporary rule of an audiencia
in the Philippines was in 1593, after the murder of Governor
G&oacute;mez P&eacute;rez Dasmari&ntilde;as. Pedro de Rojas, who had
been a magistrate of the audiencia when it was suppressed in 1589, was
at that time sole judge, with the additional rank of
lieutenant-governor and <i lang="es">asesor</i>, standing next to the
governor in authority.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12457src" href=
"#xd21e12457" name="xd21e12457src">27</a> After the death of
G&oacute;mez P&eacute;rez Dasmari&ntilde;as, Rojas had occupied the
governor&rsquo;s chair less than a year when he was succeeded by the
deceased governor&rsquo;s son, Lu&iacute;s P&eacute;rez
Dasmari&ntilde;as, who became governor on the authority of a royal
order found among the papers of his father, whereby he was given the
power to name his successor.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12466src" href=
"#xd21e12466" name="xd21e12466src">28</a> His tenure seems to have been
only temporary, however, for as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317"
href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>soon as news reached the
court of the death of the elder Dasmari&ntilde;as, Francisco Tello de
Guzm&aacute;n was appointed permanent governor and an audiencia was
sent to the Islands, arriving at Manila in 1596.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12473src" href="#xd21e12473" name="xd21e12473src">29</a>
Meanwhile Rojas was succeeded as lieutenant-governor and <i lang=
"es">asesor</i> by Antonio de Morga. According to Montero y Vidal,
Dasmari&ntilde;as turned over the government to Morga in 1595, but it
is more probable that Morga assumed the temporary governorship when
Dasmari&ntilde;as was in Cambodia and elsewhere fighting against the
Dutch. In fact, this conclusion is confirmed by
Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12482src" href=
"#xd21e12482" name="xd21e12482src">30</a> At any rate, Morga
administered both governmental and military affairs on several
occasions when the various governors were absent from the Islands,
engaged in expeditions of conquest.</p>
<p>On the suppression of the audiencia in 1589, the administration of
justice remained entirely in the hands of the lieutenant-governor and
<i lang="es">asesor</i>. This position was first occupied by Rojas, and
later by Morga, who succeeded to the same judicial duties and enjoyed
the same prerogatives as had formerly belonged to the audiencia. In the
absence of the tribunal, therefore, they assumed functions which
elsewhere were carried out by the audiencia on the death of the
governor or viceroy, partly because they had taken the place of the
audiencia, and partly because they were lieutenants-governor. After the
audiencia was re-established in 1598, Morga continued in charge of
military affairs when the governor was absent or dead, while the
audiencia administered the government, not by virtue of any laws
relating especially to the Philippines, but seemingly because this was
the general practice in all of Spain&rsquo;s colonies. Morga&rsquo;s
defense of Manila against the Dutch in 1600 has been referred to in an
earlier chapter. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318"
name="pb318">318</a>]</span></p>
<p>Not only did the audiencia do much in defense against outside
enemies at this time, but it carried on offensive operations against
them in the Moluccas after the deaths of Governors Tello and
Acu&ntilde;a. The Japanese who were residing in the city also caused
trouble, and the audiencia was under the necessity of taking repressive
measures against them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12499src" href=
"#xd21e12499" name="xd21e12499src">31</a> In 1606, while Governor
Acu&ntilde;a was absent from the colony, the fortification of Cavite,
the equipment of a fleet and the defense of the city were undertaken
and carried out successfully by Oidor Almansa.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12502src" href="#xd21e12502" name="xd21e12502src">32</a> Then on
the death of Governor Acu&ntilde;a the audiencia succeeded to the
government and it managed affairs from June 24, 1606, to June 15, 1608,
with Almansa in charge of military affairs.</p>
<p>The various governmental matters with which the audiencia concerned
itself during this period are shown in a memorial which it sent to the
king on July 6, 1606. After reporting the death of Governor
Acu&ntilde;a, and its succession to the government, the audiencia took
up questions of finance and commerce. It stated that the money in the
treasury was insufficient for the necessary expenses of the colony,
owing to the extraordinary outlays which had been necessary to defray
the costs of the wars and expeditions which had been undertaken at this
time. The audiencia suggested that the galleon returns be increased
from 500,000 to 1,000,000 pesos a year. It was pointed out in this
connection that the total cost of transporting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>goods from Manila to Acapulco, including freight
and duty, aggregated thirty per cent of their value, leaving to the
merchants a profit of only 350,000 pesos. The <i lang="es">oidores</i>
admitted that this arrangement might have been ample and satisfactory
when the colony was small or when there was peace, but at that time,
when the inhabitants of the colony had been forced to expend so much of
their revenue for defense, a larger return was necessary.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e12515src" href="#xd21e12515" name=
"xd21e12515src">33</a> Further recommendations were made regarding
commerce and the management of the galleons. It was said that their
great size encouraged smuggling; in order to avoid this, and at the
same time to contribute to the revenues of the colony, it was urged
that the ships should carry cargo to the limit of their capacity,
instead of being restricted to an insufficient amount. Large reductions
of salaries of ships&rsquo; officers, soldiers, and sailors were urged.
The <i lang="es">oidores</i> did not think it advisable to forbid the
crews and officers of the galleons to trade, however, since their
interest in the cargo would encourage them to be obedient and
loyal.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12524src" href="#xd21e12524" name=
"xd21e12524src">34</a> The audiencia <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb320" href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>concluded its
memorial with an appeal for the reform of the freight and customs
charges on the galleon. The abolition of all fixed duties was
recommended; instead, it was suggested that these duties be graduated
to meet the regular expenses of the colony as they were incurred year
by year. This recommendation was made on the basis of the theory that
duties should not be levied for the benefit of the king&rsquo;s
exchequer, but only for the support and maintenance of the merchants
and inhabitants of the colony.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12589src"
href="#xd21e12589" name="xd21e12589src">35</a> This memorial would seem
to indicate that the audiencia, when acting in the capacity of
governor, exercised considerable authority and assumed entire
responsibility for the commercial and financial affairs of the
colony.</p>
<p>Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, after describing the success of Oidor Almansa
in putting down an insurrection of the Japanese, characterized the
administration of affairs by the audiencia during this period as
follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The Royal Audience conducted themselves with great
approbation in the civil administration, until the year 1608, when Don
Rodrigo Vivero of Laredo, who was named by the Viceroy as Governor
<i lang="la">ad interim</i>, arrived at Manila, and having had great
experience in the management of the Indians in New Spain, he availed
himself of it on this occasion, giving instructions to that effect to
the chief judges, and other ministers of justice. He governed with much
satisfaction <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=
"pb321">321</a>]</span>for one year, when he delivered up the insignia
of his office, and returned to Mexico.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12602src" href="#xd21e12602" name="xd21e12602src">36</a></p>
</div>
<p>Vivero arrived in the colony on June 15, 1608. Vivero was the first
of the military governors appointed from New Spain. Under this and
succeeding arrangements, these governors exercised absolute control of
military affairs, while the audiencia concerned itself solely with
matters of government, the senior magistrate, of course, not
participating in military affairs.</p>
<p>Vivero was relieved in 1609 by Governor Juan de Silva, who had a
permanent appointment and served for seven years. Silva&rsquo;s
administration was characterized by his military exploits, chief among
which was his defense of the colony against the attacks of the Dutch
pirate, Wittert, and subsequently of Spielberg. These frequent
expeditions gave the audiencia many opportunities to assume charge of
affairs, and after Silva&rsquo;s death in the Moluccas the tribunal
ruled from April 19, 1616, to June 8, 1619. During a part of this time
Andr&eacute;s de Alcaraz, the senior magistrate, exercised the duties
of captain-general, successfully defending the city against the Dutch.
On September 30, 1617, the office of military governor devolved on
Ger&oacute;nimo de Silva, who was especially designated for the post by
the royal order of March 20, 1616.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12612src"
href="#xd21e12612" name="xd21e12612src">37</a> He was not an <i lang=
"es">oidor</i>, however, but had served as governor of Ternate, having
recently returned from the Moluccas.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12628src" href="#xd21e12628" name="xd21e12628src">38</a></p>
<p>While the post of captain-general devolved upon Silva, the audiencia
retained control of administrative affairs in the colony until Alonso
Fajardo y Tenza, the next royal appointee, arrived on June 8, 1618, to
enter upon the duties of governor and captain-general. As we have
already seen, Alcaraz was relieved of his military responsibilities on
September 30, 1617, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322"
name="pb322">322</a>]</span>and was at once obliged to submit to
<i lang="es">residencia</i>. In this trial he was compelled to answer
for his failure to warn the Chinese traders, who usually approached the
Islands at that time of the year, of the presence of the Dutch. As a
result of his oversight in this matter, a large quantity of
merchandise, including provisions for the city, had fallen into the
hands of the enemy. He was also held accountable for the disaster which
had occurred to a portion of the Spanish fleet in the battle of Playa
Honda through the appointment of the son of one of the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> to its command.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12647src"
href="#xd21e12647" name="xd21e12647src">39</a> Alcaraz, senior <i lang=
"es">oidor</i>, who was legally responsible for defense, was compelled
to answer for the failure of this inefficient commander. The choice of
a relative of one of the <i lang="es">oidores</i> was a violation of
the laws of the Indies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12661src" href=
"#xd21e12661" name="xd21e12661src">40</a> Although Oidor Alcaraz seems
to have acquitted himself well of his duties as commander of the
military forces, seven galleons were lost in an expedition to the
Moluccas during the rule of the audiencia, and considerable difficulty
was experienced in fixing responsibility for this disaster. Alcaraz
claimed that Silva was answerable; the latter maintained that the
audiencia was to blame, and the audiencia disclaimed responsibility
because, it alleged, &ldquo;the audiencia was entrusted with government
and not war.&rdquo; In an investigation ultimately made in 1625, Silva
was deprived of his office and was prevented from leaving the
Islands.</p>
<p>Governor Fajardo has left us a number of comments and criticisms of
the work of the audiencia as governor. His observations are timely and
appropriate, since the tribunal had been in charge of the government
for two years preceding his rule, and he was brought intimately in
touch with the deeds and mistakes of the previous
administration.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12666src" href="#xd21e12666"
name="xd21e12666src">41</a> Fajardo&rsquo;s comments relate to the
abuse of the appointing power by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb323" href="#pb323" name="pb323">323</a>]</span>audiencia, and the
failure of that body to provide adequately for the defense of the
colony. In support of the former charge, Fajardo said that the
magistrates had appointed several officials for life, which was
forbidden by the laws, since the audiencia was only permitted to fill
offices for the period of its rule.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12671src" href="#xd21e12671" name="xd21e12671src">42</a> The
audiencia had also infringed upon the prerogatives of the governor by
the permanent bestowal of <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>. Fajardo stated
that when he arrived in the Islands he found all the offices and
<i lang="es">encomiendas</i> filled with friends and dependents of the
<i lang="es">oidores</i>. Thus as a direct consequence the success of
his administration was impaired by the presence of officials who
regarded him, their chief, with hostility. He cited an instance in
which similar infringements upon the rights of the viceroy by the
Audiencia of Mexico had been nullified by the royal veto, and he urged
that some definite <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> or law should be
promulgated relative to these matters in the Philippines.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e12689src" href="#xd21e12689" name=
"xd21e12689src">43</a></p>
<p>The difficulty of fixing responsibility for the loss of the galleons
in the expedition to the Moluccas led Fajardo to criticise the practice
of allowing the audiencia to assume control of affairs during
vacancies. He regarded it as a cumbrous proceeding which could only
result in chaotic and incompetent government. No better results could
be expected when a body of magistrates and lawyers undertook to rule an
isolated colony, and especially when one of them assumed responsibility
for military affairs, which could not be successfully carried out by
any but a military man. He emphasized the necessity of locating
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span>responsibility for every department of
government in a central authority. He recommended the designation of
&ldquo;two military men of such standing and ability that, when the
governor and captain-general is absent, they might succeed to those
duties.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12711src" href="#xd21e12711"
name="xd21e12711src">44</a> He considered it advisable that during
vacancies, as well as when the regular governor was present, authority
should rest with one person and not be scattered or divided among a
number of magistrates.</p>
<p>Ger&oacute;nimo de Silva had been given a commission from the
viceroy to assume the post of captain-general, and upon the demise of
Fajardo in 1624, he took charge of military affairs, while the
audiencia retained the government. Silva&rsquo;s responsibility for the
loss of the ships in 1617, already referred to, as well as for other
disasters in 1624, caused him to be removed from the command and
confined in Fort Santiago where he remained until released by the new
temporary governor, Fernando de Silva, who arrived in 1625. The latter
commanded the military forces, while the audiencia administered the
government.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12716src" href="#xd21e12716"
name="xd21e12716src">45</a></p>
<p>Of far-reaching importance was the action of the audiencia in 1624,
in nullifying the action taken by the former governor, Alonso Fajardo,
relative to the construction of a seminary for Japanese priests and
students. This edifice had been partially <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb325" href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span>constructed when the
audiencia took over the government. It is interesting to note that the
<i lang="es">oidores</i>, although not collectively responsible for the
defense of the colony, took a stand on this occasion in a matter which
had to do with the common security. The objections of the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> were significant. The location of the seminary within
three hundred feet of the wall was thought to be unwise in view of the
danger of a Japanese revolt. The Japanese emperor had signified his
disapproval of Christianity on many occasions by banishing and
torturing numerous friars who had gone to Japan from the Islands. He
had forbidden the worship and propagation of Christianity in his
empire. There were at that time rumors of an impending conquest of
China and the Philippines by the Japanese, consequently the audiencia
did not wish to invite the emperor&rsquo;s wrath upon the colony by
attempting to proselyte his subjects. The audiencia thought best to
stop this before the displeasure and enmity of the Japanese were
incurred. Fear of the loss of trade with China, dread of an alliance of
the Japanese with the Dutch, making probable a concerted attack on the
Philippines, and the danger of an outbreak of the Japanese already
within the colony in conjunction with an attack by those without, were
all considerations which induced the audiencia to take responsibility
upon itself in this matter.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12742src" href=
"#xd21e12742" name="xd21e12742src">46</a></p>
<p>The official correspondence of the governor following immediately
upon the administration of an audiencia is always valuable as showing
the state of affairs under the preceding rule. That of Fernando de
Silva coincides closely with the correspondence of Governor Fajardo in
charging the audiencia with many misdeeds, chief among which were the
abuse of the appointing power and the concession of <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i> without authorization. Silva, on his accession to
the governorship, also found the finances of the colony in a bad
condition, great waste <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href=
"#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span>having been incurred in their
administration. There had been neither peace nor order; the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> had quarreled among themselves, and residents were
leaving the city as a consequence of this turmoil. The <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> had, without cause, dismissed all the officials
appointed by Fajardo, filling their places with their friends.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e12758src" href="#xd21e12758" name=
"xd21e12758src">47</a> The following account of the excesses of the
audiencia was given by Silva:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Under pretext of the arrest and removal of Don
Geronimo de Silva, Licentiate Legaspi, ... exercised the office of
captain-general, carrying the staff of office and making them lower the
banners to him, and address him as &ldquo;your Lordship,&rdquo; and his
wife as &ldquo;my lady.&rdquo; He immediately appointed his elder son
to the post of sargento-mayor of this camp, and his younger son to a
company, while another company was assigned to a relative of Auditor
Matias Flores y Cassila (also an <i lang="es">oidor</i>). Others were
assigned to brothers of the said Don Matias, the fiscal, and other
auditors, except Don Albaro (Messa y Lugo), who refused to have
anything given to his household. Upon seeing the illegality of these
appointments, I issued an act declaring them vacant and restoring those
posts to those who had held them before.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12768src" href="#xd21e12768" name="xd21e12768src">48</a></p>
</div>
<p>That the king had not entirely lost confidence in the audiencia,
notwithstanding the above complaints, is attested by the instruction
issued by the Council of the Indies to Francisco de Rojas y Ornate,
royal visitor to the Philippines.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12775src"
href="#xd21e12775" name="xd21e12775src">49</a> This communication,
which was dated August 17, 1628, approved the stand which the audiencia
had taken in insisting that all money <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb327" href="#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span>obtained from Chinese
trading-licenses should be put into the royal treasury and accounted
for by the <i lang="es">oficiales reales</i> before it was spent. It
appears that the governor had hitherto used this money as an extra fund
upon which to draw for the expenses of the colony. The king also
approved the attitude of the audiencia in denying to persons in New
Spain the right of using the Manila galleon for the shipment of their
goods, and in refusing to allow money sent by them to the Islands to be
invested in the Chinese trade. Silva contended that the audiencia had
no right to intervene in either of the above matters, but in this Silva
was not sustained, Rojas y Ornate being instructed to see that Governor
Tavora respected the action of the audiencia in the two particulars
referred to.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12783src" href="#xd21e12783"
name="xd21e12783src">50</a></p>
<p>The audiencia assumed management of political affairs in 1632, on
the death of Governor Juan Ni&ntilde;o de Tavora, but neither the
audiencia as a body, nor the senior <i lang="es">oidor</i> personally
were entrusted with the military command. This responsibility devolved
on Lorenzo de Olazo, the <i lang="es">maestre de campo</i>, who had
been designated by the viceroy of New Spain to assume temporary charge
of military affairs. He was succeeded the following year by Juan Cerezo
de Salamanca, who had been sent from Mexico by the viceroy as soon as
the death of Tavora was announced in that city. Cerezo served <i lang=
"la">ad interim</i> for three years, and during his administration the
audiencia acted solely as a judicial body, not attempting to interfere
in governmental or military affairs.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12797src" href="#xd21e12797" name="xd21e12797src">51</a> It was
under the rule of this governor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328"
href="#pb328" name="pb328">328</a>]</span>that important expeditions
were undertaken against the Moros in the South, and the first fort and
settlement were made at Zamboanga.</p>
<p>It is to be especially noted that in the appointment of Olazo and
Cerezo in 1632 and 1633 respectively, the senior <i lang="es">oidor</i>
was deprived of the control of military affairs. This had been done
also in 1617 and in 1624 when Ger&oacute;nimo de Silva, governor of
Ternate, had taken charge of military affairs during vacancies in the
regular governorship. Temporary appointments had been made on two
different occasions by the Marqu&eacute;s de Cerralbo, Viceroy of New
Spain, once in the sending of Fernando de Silva after the death of
Governor Fajardo, and on this occasion, when Cerezo de Salamanca took
the place of Governor Juan Ni&ntilde;o de Tavora, after the audiencia
had governed a year. Experience had shown that the assumption of the
military command by the senior <i lang="es">oidor</i> was not
productive of the most satisfactory results. It was not to be expected,
of course, that a magistrate would administer military affairs with the
skill of a captain-general, and we have seen that various governors
recommended that the practice should no longer be continued. So it came
about that the law of 1608 was revived, and the viceroy appointed a
temporary governor to assume control of military affairs, the audiencia
being restricted to judicial and administrative functions. In 1633, on
the accession of Cerezo de Salamanca, the audiencia was deprived of the
right of intervention in the last mentioned activity, and was confined
to its judicial duties alone. This was confirmed by the <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> of January 30, 1635, which relieved the
Audiencia of Manila of all jurisdiction over military affairs during
vacancies, ordering that they were to be administered by a temporary
appointee of the viceroy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12819src" href=
"#xd21e12819" name="xd21e12819src">52</a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, considerable opposition to this method of filling
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name=
"pb329">329</a>]</span>vacancies in the governorship had developed
within the colony. This is shown in various protests which came from
the Islands from time to time. These are set forth with great clarity
in the correspondence of the governors. Corcuera, in a letter written
to Philip IV on June 30, 1636, stated that these temporary governors
had allowed persons in Mexico to make large fortunes out of the
Philippine trade, and that the governors had devoted most of their time
when in Manila to serving as agents of the residents of Mexico.
Corcuera, however, seemed to regard the audiencia as incapable of
government, for he claimed that in the brief term of a year in which
the tribunal had ruled, three years prior to his accession, it had run
the colony into debt from 80,000 to 100,000 pesos. He charged the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> with the same dishonest practice as had been
alleged against Governor Fajardo, namely, that they had issued
due-bills in payment of debts and had bought them up later at less than
their face value, realizing the full amount on them upon their
presentation to the treasury later. He stated that these warrants were
not only bought by the <i lang="es">oidores</i>, but by practically all
the officials of the government. During Cerezo&rsquo;s term a sum in
excess of 100,000 pesos was said to have been paid out to officials as
usury.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12834src" href="#xd21e12834" name=
"xd21e12834src">53</a></p>
<p>Corcuera presented a scheme of reform designed to remedy the evils
resulting from the succession either of the audiencia or of an
irresponsible military commander to the <i lang="la">ad interim</i>
governorship. He recommended that the regularly appointed governor
should be assisted by five commissioners, who should be military men,
holding the respective commands of Fort Santiago, Cavite, the Port of
Manila, Formosa, and the <i lang="es">Pari&aacute;n</i>. These were to
be eligible in the order named in case of a vacancy. This plan, like so
many of the schemes of the soldier governors, only took cognizance of
the military side of the governor&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb330" href="#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span>office. The marked
tendency of these commanders was to continually underestimate the
administrative and political phases of their positions. The plan of
Corcuera was not adopted, however, and the viceroy continued to appoint
temporary governors to succeed the audiencia when it assumed the
government <i lang="la">ad interim</i>.</p>
<p>Governor Diego Fajardo, on July 10, 1651, wrote a letter to the king
protesting against the policy of appointment which was then in force.
He said:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">I should be unfaithful to Your Majesty if I did not
advise you of the inconveniences arising from the appointment of
governors by the Viceroy of New Spain; the practice of sending money
from Mexico for investment in this colony has continued and increased,
to the exclusion and deprivation of the merchants of these Islands....
Investments have been made by the viceroys through the agency of
others.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12857src" href="#xd21e12857" name=
"xd21e12857src">54</a></p>
</div>
<p>Fajardo urged that the audiencia should be permitted to retain the
government as it had done formerly. He showed the advantages accruing
to the colony from a continuity of policy which would result from the
rule of the <i lang="es">oidores</i>. He showed that the incursions of
the viceroys and residents of Mexico upon the galleon trade would more
likely be checked by the <i lang="es">oidores</i> than by any other
agency, adding moreover that this particular matter should be attended
to at once since the life and prosperity of the colony depended on the
control of the Acapulco and Chinese commerce by the merchants of
Manila.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12868src" href="#xd21e12868" name=
"xd21e12868src">55</a> A similar argument was presented by Governor
Manrique de Lara in a letter written July 19, 1654. This governor urged
that a commission of magistrates, familiar with the needs of the colony
through experience and long residence, was better fitted to rule for
the common good than a stranger, appointed by a distant viceroy, coming
to the Islands as most of the temporary governors had done, with the
sole purpose of exploitation.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12872src"
href="#xd21e12872" name="xd21e12872src">56</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name="pb331">331</a>]</span></p>
<p>Probably the sentiments of the residents and officials of the
Philippines were best and most effectively expressed on this subject in
the letter written by the audiencia to the king on July 19,
1654.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12878src" href="#xd21e12878" name=
"xd21e12878src">57</a> The audiencia, on this occasion, described the
inconveniences resulting from the appointment of a resident of the
Islands by the Viceroy of New Spain. It was alleged that these
appointees, being already established in the Islands as merchants,
officials, lawyers, and even as soldiers, spent all their time in the
service of their own special interests. The commercial abuses of these
appointees were said to be notorious. The presence of so many
relatives, friends, and business connections made it impossible for
these temporary rulers to officiate properly as presidents of the
audiencia, or to administer the affairs of the government with
diligence and impartiality.</p>
<p>As a result of the general dissatisfaction in the colony, which was
reflected in the above letters, and in compliance with the repeated
requests previously made for reform, the law of April 2, 1664, was
proclaimed, and followed by the <i lang="es">consulta</i> of September
9, 1669, which has been already referred to. These laws still
recognized the right of the Viceroy of New Spain to appoint governors
temporarily, but these were no longer to be designated in advance from
the residents of the Islands. While the senior magistrate was to have
charge of military affairs, he was to seek the advice of such military
officials as were stationed in the colony, &ldquo;exercising very
particular care and vigilance in all that pertains to military affairs,
endeavoring to keep the <i lang="es">presidios</i> well stocked and
provided with all the defenses necessary for whatever occasion may
arise.&rdquo; This, then, was a return to the practice which had
prevailed prior to September 13, 1608, when the Viceroy of New Spain
was first authorized to appoint a temporary governor <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name="pb332">332</a>]</span>in
advance of the death of the incumbent. Although the audiencia assumed
the government with partial legal justification from 1593 onward, the
period from 1664 to 1719 may rightly be said to constitute the era of
the audiencia&rsquo;s authorized rule.</p>
<p>An occasion for the exercise of the new law occurred in 1668, when
Governor Diego de Salcedo was arrested and imprisoned by the commissary
of the Inquisition. In accordance with the law of April 2, 1664, just
referred to, the audiencia was entitled to assume the government until
the arrival of the provisional governor from New Spain. A dispute arose
between the two most eligible <i lang="es">oidores</i>, Francisco de
Coloma and Francisco Montemayor y Mansilla, for the honors of the
military command. Coloma had been commissioned as magistrate of the
Audiencia of Manila before Montemayor, who maintained his claim to the
headship of military affairs on the grounds that he had arrived in the
Philippines earlier than Coloma.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12905src"
href="#xd21e12905" name="xd21e12905src">58</a> These two officials were
unable to agree as to their respective rights, and Juan Manuel de la
Pe&ntilde;a B&oacute;nifaz, junior magistrate of the audiencia, took
advantage of the discord to further his own interests. Put forward by
the commissary of the Inquisition and by the ecclesiastical element of
the colony as arbiter in the contention between his two colleagues, he
solidified his own power until he was able to usurp the entire
government. He issued orders to the soldiers, compromised with Coloma,
exiled Montemayor, enacted financial and governmental measures,
appointed his friends to office, and in general acted the part of a
dictator, combining in his own person all the functions of the
military, judicial and executive departments.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12911src" href="#xd21e12911" name="xd21e12911src">59</a> The
audiencia, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=
"pb333">333</a>]</span>of course, was entirely suppressed. Certain
ecclesiastical authorities state that he governed with greater
consideration and fairness than many of his predecessors, and that his
rule was more just than that of the audiencia had been.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e12924src" href="#xd21e12924" name=
"xd21e12924src">60</a> The spirit of his administration was
particularly favorable to the churchmen, by whose favor he gained
office, and by whose aid he was able to retain his position. His
successor, Manuel de Le&oacute;n, was appointed regular governor as
soon as news of the arrest of Salcedo reached Spain. B&oacute;nifaz was
apprehended and sentenced to pay the customary penalty for treason, but
death intervened and defrauded the king&rsquo;s justice. It may be
considered, in a sense, that B&oacute;nifaz conferred a service upon
the colony by forcibly putting an end to the disputes which had been
prevalent between the rival <i lang="es">oidores</i> whose claims could
not have been settled for three years at least&mdash;the time necessary
for the Council of the Indies to transmit to the distant colony a
ruling on the points at issue.</p>
<p>The audiencia next took over the government in April, 1679, on the
death of Governor Le&oacute;n, and it retained control of affairs until
the arrival of Governor Juan de Vargas Hurtado in September, 1678. The
rule of the tribunal on this occasion was without sensational features.
Oidor Francisco de Coloma, in whose favor the Council of the Indies had
declared in the dispute described above, assumed charge of military
affairs, serving as captain-general until his death. His seniority was
acknowledged by Montemayor, who was called back from exile to a place
in the audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12936src" href=
"#xd21e12936" name="xd21e12936src">61</a></p>
<p>The inefficiency of the audiencia as a governing agency as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span>shown in the episode just described was
surpassed by the state of utter impotency to which the tribunal was
reduced during the Pardo controversy in 1684. Though at first
successful in exiling the archbishop, the audiencia and Governor Vargas
were later completely undone by the intriguing of the new governor,
Curuzaelegui, with the prelate to discredit the previous
administration. The struggle ended in the restoration of the prelate,
the <i lang="es">residencia</i> of Vargas and the appointment of a new
tribunal which was calculated to be more subservient to the commands of
the new governor and the prelate. This audiencia assumed the government
after the death of Curuzaelegui on April 17, 1689, with Alonzo de
&Aacute;vila as chief executive.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12949src"
href="#xd21e12949" name="xd21e12949src">62</a></p>
<p>The events of the Pardo controversy prepared the way for a period of
rule by an audiencia in which the entire government was dominated by
the ecclesiastics. Archbishop Pardo and his successors were the real
governors and the victory of the church over the various officials of
civil administration lowered the moral tone of the entire government.
Corruption flourished and the vigor of the administration
decayed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12956src" href="#xd21e12956" name=
"xd21e12956src">63</a> It is clear that the depravity of the civil
government proceeded largely from the weakness of the audiencia and its
submission to the governor. The latter was under orders from no less an
authority than the king, himself, to put an end to the disputes between
church and state in the colony and to bring about peace; it also
happened that the situation in the colony at that time caused the
governor to lean towards the side of Pardo and his supporters. The
audiencia was entirely disregarded both <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb335" href="#pb335" name="pb335">335</a>]</span>by Governor
Curuzaelegui and by the court, which may be attributed in some measure
to that policy of the Spanish government previously alluded
to&mdash;that of sacrificing principle in order to preserve harmony.
There is no doubt but that the weakness and inefficiency of the
audiencia during these two controversies contributed largely to the
subsequent decision of the court to deprive the audiencia of the right
of governing <i lang="la">ad interim</i>.</p>
<p>The last occasion on which the audiencia regularly assumed the
government of the Islands, and one which demonstrated still more
conclusively the inefficiency of the audiencia as governor, occurred in
1715, after the death of Governor Lizarraga. His rule had been
uncommonly quiet and peaceful, and the period of extortion and strife
which succeeded it furnished a marked contrast to that governor&rsquo;s
administration. The audiencia ruled from February 4, 1715, to August 9,
1717, with Oidor Jos&eacute; Torralba as senior magistrate. The reports
sent by Torralba to the court during the two years of his service as
military commander show that the audiencia as a body played a very
small part in the government. This was again the rule of a dictator. We
have seen in a former chapter that Torralba was held accountable in his
<i lang="es">residencia</i> for a deficit of 700,000 pesos which
developed during this period;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12975src"
href="#xd21e12975" name="xd21e12975src">64</a> it is difficult to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=
"pb336">336</a>]</span>understand how this could have been possible had
the senior magistrate concerned himself solely with military affairs.
Concepci&oacute;n states that Torralba, inflated by his position, and
ambitious of getting absolute control of the government, drove from
office the <i lang="es">oidores</i> who dared to oppose him.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e12994src" href="#xd21e12994" name=
"xd21e12994src">65</a> He refused to honor the royal <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> of April 15, 1713, which ordered the
reinstatement of Oidor Pav&oacute;n to his place as senior <i lang=
"es">oidor</i> since the fulfillment of this order would have deprived
Torralba of his command.</p>
<p>Torralba reported great progress in the repair and restoration of
royal and municipal warehouses, hospitals, convents, and churches
during his administration. The wall of Manila was re-built and new
bronze guns were cast and placed thereon. As acting captain-general,
Torralba inspected Fort Santiago, and, &ldquo;noting grave needs both
in construction and in the morale of troops,&rdquo; made the necessary
repairs, reforms and corrections.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13012src"
href="#xd21e13012" name="xd21e13012src">66</a> He concerned himself
also with the promotion and appointment of military officials. These
latter acts were vigorously resisted by the <i lang="es">maestre de
campo</i>, and by other military officials, as encroachments on their
authority. They ultimately sought to bring about the nullification of
all Torralba&rsquo;s &ldquo;unjustifiable acts of interference within
the military sphere.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13018src" href=
"#xd21e13018" name="xd21e13018src">67</a> Whether animated by a sincere
desire to see the natives justly treated, or rather by his natural
dislike of the friars, Torralba intervened on various occasions for the
protection of the Indians against the encroachments and abuses of the
churchmen on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337"
name="pb337">337</a>]</span><i lang="es">encomiendas</i> and in the
native towns. These acts were carried out in the name of the audiencia,
and in accordance with the law, ultimately meeting with the approval of
the Council of the Indies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13025src" href=
"#xd21e13025" name="xd21e13025src">68</a></p>
<p>A great deal of dissatisfaction, both at the court and in the
colony, had resulted from the audiencia&rsquo;s assumption of the
government at various times since 1664. We have already noted that the
restoration of this authority to the audiencia was attended by the
disgraceful quarrel between Coloma and Montemayor and the usurpation of
B&oacute;nifaz in 1668. The Pardo controversy did not produce a
favorable impression of the activities of the audiencia.
Torralba&rsquo;s dictatorship in the name of the audiencia from 1715 to
1717, conspicuous for the huge deficit in which it culminated,
demonstrated the unfitness of the audiencia to be entrusted with the
rule of the Islands.</p>
<p>Indeed, it may be said that the various experiments made by the
monarchs during the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries for the
purpose of perfecting a system whereby the governorship could be
satisfactorily filled <i lang="la">ad interim</i> had failed to
demonstrate or develop any authority capable of maintaining harmony or
decent government. Co-operation among the authorities of the colony was
practically unknown. The royal disapproval was passed upon practically
all the official acts of these interim administrations. The thirst for
personal glory, and the desire for private gain invariably induced some
official who was stronger than his contemporaries to assume control of
affairs; thus the government of the colony was made repeatedly to
subserve personal ends, and civil and political life was characterized
by its strife and discord. The probabilities that the temporary
administration of the audiencia would not be entirely successful had
been recognized from the beginning, and in order to guard against its
misrule the king had authorized the appointment <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span>of a
temporary governor by the Viceroy of New Spain. It was unavoidable,
however, that the audiencia should govern until the arrival of this
official. For a time the alternative was tried of allowing the <i lang=
"es">maestre de campo</i> to assume the military command, but this
resulted in such an incompetent rule that the former prerogatives of
the audiencia were restored. Whether the audiencia was capable of
governing successfully or not, it certainly had the power to make or
mar the government of any other person or authority, whether he was
regularly appointed by the king, or chosen temporarily by the
viceroy.</p>
<p>The church, as represented by a succession of triumphant
archbishops, had exercised the preponderance of power and authority
throughout the forty years of strife, ending with the death of Governor
Bustamante. We need not be concerned here with the various struggles
and disagreements with governors and audiencias, but the fact remains
that the church was the only institution existing during this period
which was able to present a solid and united front to its enemies, or
which manifested any symptoms of power, unity or royal approbation. The
culmination of ecclesiastical power was virtually reached on October
11, 1719, when Governor Bustamante was murdered by emissaries of the
church and Fray Francisco de la Cuesta, Archbishop of Manila, assumed
the vacant governorship.</p>
<p>Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, the Dominican historian, says that the
archbishop declined the governorship on this occasion, but was
subsequently prevailed upon to accept it.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13047src" href="#xd21e13047" name="xd21e13047src">69</a> It is
certain that the tribunal was in no state or condition to take charge
of affairs; its administration had been discredited by the murder of
its protector, its senior magistrate had been proved an embezzler in
his <i lang="es">residencia</i>, and the remaining members of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span>tribunal were not qualified to remain in office.
Oidores Villa and Pav&oacute;n, removed by Torralba and Bustamante,
were restored by the archbishop, and were content to recognize him as
president of the audiencia. Each of them had his own claims to the
position of acting-governor and had Cuesta not occupied the
governorship with their consent, these <i lang="es">oidores</i> would
either have been languishing in banishment as punishment for having
resisted the prelate, or they would have been struggling for the honors
of a position occupied by a pretended mediator, as on former occasions.
So there can be no doubt that it was best for all concerned that the
church was powerful at this time; the colony had had enough of strife
and murder and there was urgent need of some authority with sufficient
power to bring about peace. It is sufficient to say that the audiencia
renounced its claims to the government, and, according to
Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, who devotes an unusual amount of space to this
important epoch in the ecclesiastical history of the Islands, the
people were very content with the archbishop&rsquo;s rule after the
injustice and oppression of Bustamante.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13061src" href="#xd21e13061" name="xd21e13061src">70</a> It may
be noted that the archbishop exercised complete authority over the
audiencia, even to the extent of restoring <i lang="es">oidores</i> who
had been unlawfully dismissed, and of acting as an intermediary between
magistrates. He was master of the situation and his interim rule was
preferred by the sovereign and by the people to that of the
audiencia.</p>
<p>The royal order of September 8, 1720, legalizing the government
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name=
"pb340">340</a>]</span>of the prelates, applied not only to the
administration of Cuesta, but it established a precedent for the
temporary rule of four prelates.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13078src"
href="#xd21e13078" name="xd21e13078src">71</a> In compliance with this
decree, three sealed envelopes (<i lang="es">pliegos de
providencia</i>) were sent to the audiencia to be placed unopened in
the archives of that tribunal, and the seals were to be broken only on
the death of the governor. These envelopes were accompanied by an order
from the king, directing that the person mentioned in the first
envelope should be recognized as temporary governor. In case of his
absence or incapacity to serve, the second envelope was to be opened
and the directions contained therein were to be followed, and if these
could not be complied with, the third envelope was to be opened.</p>
<p>No further necessity for the observance of this law of succession
arose until after the death of Governor Gaspar de la Torre, when, on
August 15, 1745, the first envelope was opened in the presence of the
audiencia. The post of archbishop being vacant at this time it became
necessary to follow the directions prescribed by the second envelope.
It was found that Fray Juan de Arrechedera, Bishop of Nueva Segovia,
had been designated as the governor&rsquo;s successor. The audiencia
relinquished the control of affairs into his hands and he governed for
a period of five years.</p>
<p>It would seem that the ecclesiastical calling of this governor in no
way incapacitated or hindered him in the execution of his duties. His
administration was characterized especially by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name=
"pb341">341</a>]</span>various measures taken for the defense and
fortification of the Islands. He suppressed several insurrections in
Ilocos and Cagay&aacute;n, dispatching military forces under the
command of <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> against the revolting
natives. He repelled several Moro raids and made treaties of peace with
the Sultan of Sulu.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13106src" href=
"#xd21e13106" name="xd21e13106src">72</a> There is no evidence of
discord between the governor and the audiencia during this period.
Although Archbishop Trinidad arrived and took possession of his see on
August 27, 1747, he made no attempt to take charge of political
affairs.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13115src" href="#xd21e13115" name=
"xd21e13115src">73</a> He permitted Arrechedera to continue as governor
for three years, handing over to him</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">a royal mandate, for the absolute expulsion of the
Chinese [which was never] ... carried into execution, the interest of
the Governor being too deeply involved in the suspension of it, the
Chinese paying him a contribution for his forbearance. The Archbishop
found that Arrechedera was strongly attached to this nation, and he
became so far a convert to his sentiments on this subject that he did
not put the royal order in force.... This seems to have been the only
error committed by this illustrious prelate during the time he held the
government. In all other respects his conduct reflected the highest
honour on him.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13127src" href="#xd21e13127"
name="xd21e13127src">74</a></p>
</div>
<p>The third time the government was taken over by a prelate was in
1759 on the death of Governor Arand&iacute;a. On this occasion it
became necessary to open the third <i lang="es">pliego de
providencia</i>. The metropolitan see of Manila and the diocese of
Nueva Segovia being vacant, Bishop Espeleta of Ceb&uacute; was the
senior prelate of the Islands. Shortly after the accession of Espeleta,
Manuel Rojo, the new archbishop, arrived, commanding Espeleta to vacate
the governorship at once. Rojo refused, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb342" href="#pb342" name="pb342">342</a>]</span>citing the precedent
established by Bishop Arrechedera. Espeleta appealed to the audiencia
for support, but the <i lang="es">oidores</i> were unable to agree on
the question, two of them, Calder&oacute;n and Galb&aacute;n supporting
Rojo, and the other two remaining in favor of the retention of the
governorship by Espeleta. The question was left to the <i lang=
"es">fiscal</i>, Francisco Leandro de Viana, who advised that the
matter should be carried to the Council of the Indies for final
settlement.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13146src" href="#xd21e13146"
name="xd21e13146src">75</a> It transpired, therefore, that Espeleta
retained the governorship from 1759 until 1761, and he did very
effective work in repelling the raids of the Moros, who had been
ravaging the provinces with impunity for some time.</p>
<p>The prosecution of Dr. Santiago Orenda&iacute;n occupied a large
share of Espeleta&rsquo;s attention during his administration. This
controversy should be noted here because it illustrates the relations
between the audiencia and an ecclesiastical governor. Orenda&iacute;n
had been the advisor (<i lang="es">asesor</i>) of Governor
Arand&iacute;a, and was held responsible for the repressive measures
taken against the church during the administration of the latter. The
rule of an unscrupulous prelate presented an excellent opportunity for
revenge and Orenda&iacute;n&rsquo;s prosecution was unanimously
demanded by the ecclesiastical element of the colony. The magistrates
also welcomed the opportunity to retaliate upon a hitherto successful,
but unpopular, rival. The <i lang="es">fiscal</i> brought action
against Orenda&iacute;n, who sought refuge in an Augustinian convent,
whereupon the civil authorities forced an entrance into the asylum,
seizing Orenda&iacute;n and imprisoning him in Fort Santiago. The
<i lang="es">provisor</i> of the ecclesiastical court excommunicated
Magistrate Villacorta, who had exculpated Orenda&iacute;n in his trial,
but the ban was disregarded by the audiencia. A division over the
question arose in the tribunal, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343"
href="#pb343" name="pb343">343</a>]</span>and matters were assuming a
threatening aspect, when the authorized appointment of Governor Rojo
arrived. Espeleta gave up his office, and the first act of the new
governor was to restore Orenda&iacute;n to full favor as his
counsellor. The affair of Dr. Orenda&iacute;n illustrates a phase of
Spanish colonial administration which is too characteristic to be left
unnoticed here. Aside from the influence which Orenda&iacute;n
exercised over Governor Arand&iacute;a, his persecution shows the
measure of personal rancour which even a prelate might put into his
administration, spending practically two years in the pursuit of
revenge. In this he was supported by the audiencia. In this affair
neither the church nor the audiencia were animated so much by motives
of right and justice as they were influenced by personal feelings.</p>
<p>The rule of Archbishop Rojo from 1761 to 1764 was a notable one in
the history of the Philippines. The principal event during his
administration was the capture of Manila by the British. This furnished
the occasion for the resistance of Oidor Sim&oacute;n de Anda y
Salazar, in the name of the audiencia, both to the English and to the
archbishop who had ordered his surrender. These events show the
complete incapacity of an ecclesiastical governor of Rojo&rsquo;s type
and personality to fulfill the military requirements of his position.
In the operations of Anda we note how a man of decisive action, energy,
courage, and loyalty was able to force the issue and deprive the
archbishop-governor of the executive functions which he had assumed
legally, but which he was unable to dispense. This episode illustrates,
furthermore, the general disregard of the laws which placed the
governorship in the hands of a man who was unfit for its exercise,
showing again that in the selection of a person to carry out the duties
of governor the military side of the situation could not be
disregarded.</p>
<p>Anda, at the time of the accession of Rojo, was a junior magistrate
in the audiencia, having arrived in Manila on July <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name="pb344">344</a>]</span>21,
1761.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13174src" href="#xd21e13174" name=
"xd21e13174src">76</a> The British squadron entered Manila Bay on
September 22, 1762. The British subsequently attacked the city, the
fall of which seemed imminent on account of the neglectful state into
which the defense had fallen.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13177src"
href="#xd21e13177" name="xd21e13177src">77</a> The proposition was made
to the archbishop-governor by Fiscal Francisco Leandro de Viana and the
audiencia that Oidor Anda should be dispatched to the provinces with
the title of Governor and Captain-general of the Islands for the

This was the main object as stated in the original proposition of the
audiencia. Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga states the purpose of the departure of
Anda to have been &ldquo;to maintain the islands in obedience to the
King of Spain,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13221src" href=

Rojo,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13240src" href="#xd21e13240" name=
"xd21e13240src">86</a> himself. In view of these facts, Rojo&rsquo;s
failure to co-operate with Anda, his proneness to listen to those who
counseled surrender, his complete reversal of tactics in repeatedly
summoning Anda to abdicate, and his willingness even to betray Anda
into the hands of the British are almost inexplicable.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13250src" href="#xd21e13250" name=

"#pb346" name="pb346">346</a>]</span></p>
<p>Anda organized a provisional government in his capacity as
lieutenant-governor. He disregarded the repeated summons of the
archbishop to return to the city and surrender to the British. In a
letter to the archbishop, dated October 21, 1762, Anda justified his
position and made clear that he was not acting on the basis of any
delegation of power as captain-general, which authority, he
acknowledged, still rested with Rojo. He stated that he had been
appointed visitor-general of the provinces &ldquo;with the real mission
of protecting them if the English captured Manila;&rdquo; in case this
happened he was to solicit the aid of prelates, religious and <i lang=
"es">alcaldes mayores</i> in defending the Islands. He complained that
Rojo had already &ldquo;endeavored to influence the prelates, religious
and natives to submit to the British.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13285src" href="#xd21e13285" name="xd21e13285src">88</a> He urged
that Rojo should desist from his opposition to his efforts, pointing
out the great desirability of their co-operation.</p>
<p>When Anda became convinced of the infirmity of Rojo and the
uselessness of further attempts at co-operation with him he completely
changed his attitude towards his own position and towards the question
of the defense and government of the Islands. While he had hitherto
recognized Rojo as governor and captain-general, he now assumed the
position that the archbishop was a prisoner in the city and he
therefore refused <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347"
name="pb347">347</a>]</span>to recognize the orders of the latter. Anda
issued a call to all loyal inhabitants to defend the honor of Spain. He
ordered the <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> to pay no heed to the
dispatches and commands issued by the archbishop or the British in the
city. He set himself up as governor and captain-general of the Islands,
subsequently moving his capital to Bacolor, Pampanga. He obtained
possession of the funds of the royal treasury, which had been sent to
the province of Laguna when the English had appeared, and he turned a
deaf ear to the demands of the archbishop that the money should be
returned to the city in order that it might be applied on the payment
of the four million-peso war indemnity imposed by the victorious
British. Anda enlisted a military force aggregating eight thousand men,
and he successfully prevented the enemy from doing more than capture
Cavite, P&aacute;sig, and a few other places of minor importance.
Notwithstanding the demands of the British, who had placed a price of
four thousand pesos on his head, and the entreaties of the archbishop,
Anda resisted until he was assured that peace was definitely arranged
between Spain and Great Britain.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13295src"
href="#xd21e13295" name="xd21e13295src">89</a></p>
<p>The justification which Anda offered for his conduct was as follows:
the regular governor and the audiencia (excepting himself) were
prisoners in the city of Manila; their positions and places were
therefore vacant, and Anda, as the sole <i lang="es">oidor</i> who was
not incapacitated, should accordingly succeed and had succeeded to the
management of political affairs and defense. He was both audiencia and
governor. In support of his contention that he himself was the legally
constituted audiencia, he cited the law promulgated by Philip III on
August 14, 1620, declaring that &ldquo;in some of the audiencias of the
Indies it has <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span>happened, and it might happen still that the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> being absent and ... only one remaining, ...
in such cases the audiencia is to be conserved and continued with only
one <i lang="es">oidor</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13311src"
href="#xd21e13311" name="xd21e13311src">90</a> Anda had been a legally
appointed <i lang="es">oidor</i> on special delegation to the provinces
when the city fell into the hands of the British; the governor and the
remaining <i lang="es">oidores</i> had become prisoners and were
civilly dead; being the only magistrate of the audiencia yet on duty,
he was at once audiencia and governor. He stated that he would
surrender his office to the archbishop and audiencia when both had
regained their liberty, but he warned the archbishop that if he went to
the extreme of surrendering the Islands, he (Anda) &ldquo;would in no
wise obey so unjust and absurd a treaty,&rdquo; and furthermore stated
that if the British wished to rule the country, they would have to
conquer it first. He expressed the conviction that neither the
archbishop nor any other authority except the king had the power to
surrender the Islands.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13323src" href=
"#xd21e13323" name="xd21e13323src">91</a> In these arguments and
sentiments Anda was supported by the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, Francisco
Leandro de Viana, and by Oidores Galb&aacute;n and Villacorta, who
subsequently escaped from the city and joined him in the provinces,
aiding him in his resistance to the invaders.</p>
<p>Although the British had agreed in their terms of capitulation that
the audiencia should continue in the exercise of its normal powers in
Manila,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13337src" href="#xd21e13337" name=
"xd21e13337src">92</a> that tribunal and the archbishop <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span>were
virtually prisoners; the idea of their recognition therefore appears
almost an absurdity. The <i lang="es">oidores</i> acted as members of
the council of war which considered the proposition made by the British
for the surrender of the city, but if we may trust the testimony of
Viana, the archbishop, influenced by his favorites, Monroy and
Orenda&iacute;n, forced the magistrates to sign the articles of
capitulation. Viana says that in the various matters which came up for
solution after the city had surrendered, the <i lang="es">oidores</i>
were formally consulted, but the archbishop followed his own counsel,
or that of his favorites.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13350src" href=
"#xd21e13350" name="xd21e13350src">93</a></p>
<p>The position of Rojo after the escape of the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>
and the <i lang="es">oidores</i> was an exceedingly unpleasant one. The
English commander complained that the prelate and the audiencia had
failed to keep the agreement which had been made between them; in
escaping, the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> and the <i lang="es">oidores</i>
had violated their oaths; the indemnity had not been paid; the
provinces had not surrendered and Anda was still continuing his
resistance. The sack of the city was threatened. These conditions made
Rojo redouble his efforts to betray Anda and to get possession of the
treasure which had come on the <i lang="es">patache</i>,
&ldquo;Filipino&rdquo;. The British offered remission of tribute to all
natives then in insurrection who would surrender. Anda was charged with
responsibility for the danger with which the city was threatened. He
was said to have prevented the fulfillment of the treaty between Rojo
and the British. To this Anda replied that he had not been a party to
the treaty. The state of perpetual worry in which Rojo was kept brought
about his death on January 30, 1764. Even before this he had
practically lost his status as governor and the British were treating
with Anda for the surrender of the Islands.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13372src" href="#xd21e13372" name="xd21e13372src">94</a> This
continued until the legitimacy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350"
href="#pb350" name="pb350">350</a>]</span>of the position of Anda was
recognized by Governor Torre.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13377src"
href="#xd21e13377" name="xd21e13377src">95</a></p>
<p>A statement of the above facts aids in clarifying our view of
Anda&rsquo;s position. It certainly can be said that there was neither
an audiencia nor a governor with sovereign powers in Manila; this lack
furnished a reasonable basis for Anda&rsquo;s claims. However clearly
it was established that a vacancy existed in the governorship, his
position would have been sufficiently tenable had it been based solely
on the grounds that the archbishop had delegated him as lieutenant of
the captain-general, with military powers. The archbishop-governor had
granted him that title and those powers for the very purpose for which
he had utilized them, namely, for the defense of the Islands against
the British. In view of the support which was extended to Anda in his
contention that he was governor and captain-general as long as the
archbishop and the regularly constituted audiencia were prisoners, it
is not easy to understand why it was necessary for him to justify
himself by advancing the claim, first, that he was the audiencia, and,
second, that he was the governor because he had the authority of the
audiencia. The only accountable reason for this was probably the
necessity of nullifying the commands of the archbishop which were being
issued from the captured city. He may have felt that such measures were
imperative in order to gain and retain the respect of the natives and
provincial officials who were not under his immediate influence and who
were consequently more independent and inclined to be insurrectionary
and riotous. Yet, it is hardly possible that the legal arguments
advanced in support of his claims were understood by this class.</p>
<p>It does not appear, moreover, that Anda was entirely justified in
his argument by the laws. No doubt he was right in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name=
"pb351">351</a>]</span>regarding himself as the audiencia, on the basis
of the laws cited by him. However, the law did not at that time
authorize the succession of the audiencia to a vacancy in the
governorship. The <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> of September 8, 1720,
and of August 15, 1731, were still in force in the Philippines, and by
virtue of these and by the special <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i>
promulgated in 1761 in favor of Rojo, an ecclesiastic was authorized to
act as governor in case of a vacancy. According to law and precedent,
the post vacated by the archbishop-governor should have been filled by
the bishop of Nueva Segovia, and by the bishop of Ceb&uacute;,
respectively. It is true that neither of these ecclesiastics put forth
any effort to maintain their legal rights, probably for the reason that
they realized their incapacity to organize and conduct the defense of
the Islands as well as Anda had done. The audiencia had not succeeded
to the government since 1715; it had been forbidden to do so in 1720
and subsequently. It is therefore difficult to understand how Anda
could have seriously advanced the claim that in his capacity as sole
<i lang="es">oidor</i> he should succeed to the government.</p>
<p>Aside from the opposition of the archbishop, there does not seem to
have been any great difference of opinion on the question of whether
Anda could rightfully claim the prerogatives of the audiencia and
governorship at the same time. Rojo paid no attention to the legal
arguments advanced by Anda, but contended that both the governor and
the audiencia were still in full possession of their powers and in
complete enjoyment of their liberties within the city. No comment is to
be found on Anda&rsquo;s contention in the royal dispatches which were
sent in answer to his reports. It is important to note, however, that
after the death of the archbishop, and after the restoration of peace,
the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> was of the opinion that the government
should go to Fray Ust&aacute;riz, bishop of Nueva Segovia.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13400src" href="#xd21e13400" name=
"xd21e13400src">96</a> In this opinion he was seconded by Oidor
Galb&aacute;n. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name=
"pb352">352</a>]</span></p>
<p>It would seem that Anda was supported in his resistance to
Archbishop Rojo and the British largely on grounds of expediency. This
is clearly brought out in a letter which Fiscal Viana wrote to the king
on October 30, 1762, stating his opinion that:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Since the Audiencia and governor are unable to
exercise their duties, Anda, as the only active and unembarrassed
minister who is able to retain his place under the authority of Your
Majesty, has declared himself governor, royal audiencia and
captain-general. It is evident that, being a prisoner, the archbishop
cannot be governor and captain-general, and it is equally certain that
the government and office of captain-general falls back on the
audiencia and the oldest <i lang="es">oidor</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13415src" href="#xd21e13415" name="xd21e13415src">97</a></p>
</div>
<p>This argument savors of expediency and sound practicability rather
than of interest in the legal quibble. Had Viana been convinced of the
legality of Anda&rsquo;s claims he would not subsequently have
supported Ust&aacute;riz. Viana contended that neither the archbishop
nor the audiencia enjoyed sovereign powers when they were prisoners.
Anda, on the other hand, was in such a position that he could utilize
his legal powers; he used them to good advantage and effectively,
therefore he was entitled to recognition.</p>
<p>Aside from the question of legality, it is important to note that
Anda was the only person who was able to exercise sovereign powers
during this time. It is certain, moreover, that he prevented the
Islands from falling into the hands of the British and that he
maintained the continuity of the sovereignty of Spain in the Islands
from 1762 to 1764. During his rule in the provinces he exercised
practically all the functions of a normal government. Aside from the
management of military affairs he administered the finances and levied
tribute. As noted above, he contrived to obtain possession of the royal
treasure which had been sent to Laguna; he was consequently better
equipped financially than he would have been otherwise, and better than
his rivals in the city. His <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href=
"#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>finances were also augmented by
the favorable circumstance of his capture of the &ldquo;Filipino&rdquo;
which was returning from Acapulco with the proceeds of the sale of her
former cargo.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13424src" href="#xd21e13424"
name="xd21e13424src">98</a></p>
<p>Other functions of a semi-military and governmental character were
exercised by Anda in his capacity as acting governor. In some of these
matters he was assisted by the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> and audiencia in
the latter part of his administration. He regulated the prices of
provisions in order to prevent them from attaining prohibitive
proportions. He did all that he could to further and encourage
interprovincial trade. He issued orders in regulation of wages. In
order to discourage drunkenness he forbade the sale of <i lang=
"es">nipa</i> wine except in small quantities. He discouraged the
importation of wine from Laguna. He took measures to prevent the
Chinese from counterfeiting or chipping coins, and he declared what
should be legal tender. He forbade the shipment of provisions to the
beleaguered city and refused to permit the natives under his
jurisdiction to shelter or otherwise assist an Englishman. He prevented
secular priests from communicating with the archbishop. In order to
encourage service in the army he exempted natives from the <i lang=
"es">polo</i>, or labor tax, and he also made certain exceptions to the
general rule for the payment of tribute to offset the decree of the
British who had offered wholesale exemption from the payment of tribute
in order to attract the natives. Anda issued very severe orders to
prevent looting and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354"
name="pb354">354</a>]</span>extortion on the part of his soldiers.
Because of the alliance between the Chinese and the British, Anda was
obliged to take repressive measures against the former. He forbade
games of dice, cock-fighting and card-playing so as to raise the morale
of the natives, to prevent thefts and to encourage law and order. He
prescribed the death penalty for theft. Anda&rsquo;s rule was little
less than a dictatorship, with all the powers of government centered in
himself and in his immediate advisors.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13449src" href="#xd21e13449" name="xd21e13449src">99</a></p>
<p>It has already been pointed out that when Anda&rsquo;s resistance
gave certain assurances of success, the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, Viana,
and the <i lang="es">oidores</i>, Galb&aacute;n and Villacorta, escaped
to his capital, attached themselves to his cause and assumed a share in
his government. Anda was willing to recognize them as magistrates of
the audiencia, and as such they officiated. Villacorta made some
trouble for Anda, however, by claiming the right to act as governor on
the ground that he was Anda&rsquo;s senior in the audiencia. This was
generally recognized, but Anda refused to accede to his demands, and
the matter was dropped for a time.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13460src"
href="#xd21e13460" name="xd21e13460src">100</a> Anda found that his
colleagues, Viana and Galb&aacute;n, were of the opinion that Bishop
Ust&aacute;riz was legally entitled to the office of governor, but
there was some doubt in their minds whether he should be invited at
that time to act as governor. Anda consulted the Bishop of Camarines
and that prelate expressed his willingness to submit to the decision of
the audiencia. The Augustinians and Dominicans were of the same
opinion, but the Jesuits and Franciscans</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">told him, that in the then (<i>sic</i>) situation of
the islands he alone could preserve the public tranquillity, and on
that account he ought to retain the supreme authority. This diversity
of opinion was not very gratifying to Se&ntilde;or Anda, and although
the troops were in his favour, he was by no means desirous of having
recourse to violence.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13472src" href=
"#xd21e13472" name="xd21e13472src">101</a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name=
"pb355">355</a>]</span></p>
<p>Shortly after the death of Archbishop Rojo, Anda received dispatches
informing him that peace had been restored between Spain and
England;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13483src" href="#xd21e13483" name=
"xd21e13483src">102</a> at the same time the British received orders to
evacuate the city. Now that Anda&rsquo;s presence in the field as
military commander was no longer absolutely required, a three-cornered
fight arose among the supporters of Villacorta, Ust&aacute;riz and
Anda. Each of these contenders was able to advance a reasonable claim.
Villacorta was certainly the senior magistrate, and thus he had a
better right legally to the office than Anda. Ust&aacute;riz was bishop
of Nueva Segovia and as such, was entitled to the governorship
according to the most recent law. &ldquo;Anda had in his favor the
circumstance of having defended the islands, and of having prevented
the English from advancing to the northern provinces; and, above all,
he commanded the troops, who were attached to him, and this served to
check the pretensions of the others.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13495src" href="#xd21e13495" name="xd21e13495src">103</a></p>
<p>The arrival of the interim governor, Francisco Xavier de la Torre,
put an end to these disputes. He had been dispatched to the Islands by
the Viceroy of New Spain with the title of <i lang="es">teniente del
rey</i> (king&rsquo;s lieutenant), and in accordance with his
instructions he assumed the temporary government on March 17, 1764,
which he retained until the arrival of Governor Ra&oacute;n in July,
1765. Anda&rsquo;s <i lang="es">residencia</i> was taken by his
successor, and it was found that the finances of the colony had been
faithfully and honestly administered during his administration.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name=
"pb356">356</a>]</span>He was able to account for all of the money
taken from the &ldquo;Filipino&rdquo;, turning over two million pesos
of these funds to the new governor, accounting for the balance. Anda
was recalled to Spain, where he was presented at court, receiving the
personal thanks of the sovereign.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13511src"
href="#xd21e13511" name="xd21e13511src">104</a></p>
<p>Torre&rsquo;s accession to the governorship marks the discontinuance
in the Philippines of the practice of allowing the archbishop to take
charge of the government during vacancies. On no subsequent occasion in
the history of the Islands did an ecclesiastic take over the rule of
the Islands.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13517src" href="#xd21e13517"
name="xd21e13517src">105</a> It would seem that this plan of succession
was abandoned quite generally throughout Spain&rsquo;s dominions,
though there is no instance in which the rule of a prelate ever
resulted quite so disastrously as in the Philippines from 1762 to 1764.
Torre&rsquo;s accession marks the return to the practice introduced in
1608 and followed from time to time throughout the history of the
Islands.</p>
<p>The audiencia, as a tribunal, concerned itself no further with the
temporary government of the Islands. On September 30, 1762, a new
<i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> authorized the appointment of a <i lang=
"es">teniente del rey</i> by the viceroy of New Spain, and the
succession of this official was ordered in case of a vacancy. This law
was repromulgated on two subsequent occasions, the first time on
November 23, 1774, and again on July 2, 1779.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13534src" href="#xd21e13534" name="xd21e13534src">106</a> The
plan of succession which it authorized was followed quite generally in
the subsequent history of the Islands, until the separation of New
Spain in 1821 rendered impossible the appointment of a <i lang=
"es">teniente</i> by the viceroy. Anda&rsquo;s government was the last
occasion on which the audiencia, in reality or in theory, ever
attempted to rule by its own right, except by association with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name=
"pb357">357</a>]</span>the <i lang="es">teniente del rey</i>, with whom
it acted in the usual advisory capacity, as authorized in the
above-mentioned laws.</p>
<p>By the Royal Instruction of Regents of 1776, the regent was
authorized to act as president of the audiencia during the absence of
the governor, and in case there were no regent, the senior magistrate
of the audiencia was to take his place.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13550src" href="#xd21e13550" name="xd21e13550src">107</a> This
law was confirmed by the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of August 2,
1789, which ordered that viceroys and presidents, on going outside of
their capitals, &ldquo;should assign to the regents the faculties for
the dispatch of the most important and immediate
affairs.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13562src" href="#xd21e13562"
name="xd21e13562src">108</a> A subsequent law, dated July 30, 1779,
stated that &ldquo;these important and immediate affairs&rdquo; did not
include &ldquo;the duties and functions of the captain-general.&rdquo;
Again, the royal order of October 23, 1806,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13567src" href="#xd21e13567" name="xd21e13567src">109</a>
commanded that the audiencia should in no case take control of the
government when there was a vacancy, but that the name of the temporary
governor should be contained in an envelope which was to be opened on
the death of the governor, or on his absence from the district. In case
provision had not been made in this way, it was ordered that the
government should be taken over by the ranking military officer of the
colony, if he were higher than the grade of colonel; if not, the regent
or <i lang="es">decano</i> should be temporary president, governor and
captain-general, without ceding the exercise of any of the functions of
this office to the audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13576src"
href="#xd21e13576" name="xd21e13576src">110</a> This law was suspended
by the royal order of July 12, 1812, and by the decree of November 2,
1834, which ordered that the <i lang="es">segundo cabo</i>, or
lieutenant-commander of the king&rsquo;s forces should succeed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name=

applicable throughout the Spanish colonial empire. Subsequent vacancies
in the Philippines were filled by military men, and the audiencia
refrained from interference with the government.</p>
<p>Considering the question in its broadest phases, it cannot be said
that the audiencia administered the <i lang="la">ad interim</i> rule
with a great degree of success. This method of filling vacancies in the
governorship failed for a number of reasons. Owing to the divided
composition of the tribunal, the rivalry and personal <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e13603" title="Source: jealously">jealousy</span> of the
magistrates and the perpetual quarrels and struggles which arose as a
consequence, the periods of its rule became wild scrambles for power in
which the strongest survived and reaped all the benefits of office. By
their example, the <i lang="es">oidores</i> stimulated others to
wrong-doing, and in their efforts to secure advantages for themselves
they oppressed the residents, Spanish and native, with the burden of
their misrule. They did not scruple to indulge in dishonest practices
whenever occasion offered; indeed, they went out of their way to seek
such opportunities.</p>
<p>Perhaps the gravest defect of the rule of the audiencia lay in its
failure as an executive, owing to the divided character of its
composition. There was much jealousy, but neither unity nor centralized
responsibility. In their governmental capacity the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> frequently enacted measures and made recommendations
of a statesmanlike character, although they did not always succeed in
enforcing them. The magistrates were neither experienced legislators
nor trained soldiers, and the latter defect seems to have been a cause
of considerable dissatisfaction, especially among the military classes.
These were naturally jealous of an assumption of military power by
lawyers, whose commands they refused to obey. Nevertheless it must be
conceded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name=
"pb359">359</a>]</span>that such individual <i lang="es">oidores</i> as
Morga, Alcaraz, Almansa and Anda acquitted themselves of their military
duties with great credit when called upon.</p>
<p>The reform which gave the government to the churchmen was designed
to obviate the defects expressed above. It was believed that a prelate
would not be open to so many ventures of a questionable and mainly
commercial character. Moreover, the archbishops in Mexico and elsewhere
had fulfilled the duties of the executive on former occasions with a
fair degree of success. The church was the most powerful, highly
centralized and unified institution in the Philippines at the time when
both the audiencia and the governorship were weakest. The
ecclesiastical authority had repeatedly triumphed over the civil
government, and the former gave promise of being able to control
matters more effectively in the future than the audiencia had done in
the past. The rule of the churchmen did not remedy matters, however,
except that it produced harmony through the exercise of force. During
the rule of the archbishops, with the exception of that of Rojo, the
audiencia was so completely dominated by the ecclesiastical power that
the tribunal could scarcely be considered a factor in the
government.</p>
<p>There were various defects in the rule of the ecclesiastics. Of
these, perhaps the most prominent was their failure to meet the
military requirements of the position. Because of the natural
incongruity existing between ecclesiastical and military duties, they
were obliged to delegate the command of the troops to military leaders,
who thus exercised an influence never realized by them during the rule
of the audiencia. Archbishop Rojo was unwilling to trust the problem of
defense to any other person, though unable to cope with the situation
himself. Hence Anda forced his way to the front because he was fitted
to command and Rojo was not. As administrators and executives the
prelates were as efficient as any others, but they were never able
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=
"pb360">360</a>]</span>to reconcile successfully the opposition of the
civil, political, and commercial elements, who were displeased with the
rule of an ecclesiastic. Surprising as it may seem, the government of a
prelate was usually most unsatisfactory to the churchmen and religious
authorities. If the prelate-governor were a friar, his rule was
resented by the members of all the rival orders. If he were a secular
priest, he was opposed by the friars of all the orders.</p>
<p>The failure of Rojo was enough to condemn the practice of permitting
ecclesiastics to assume the government, but aside from that, there was
a more significant and fundamental reason. The increasing political
authority of the church at that time, both in the colonies and in the
mother country, its widespread and almost irresistible dominance over
temporal affairs, demanded a radical change of policy whereby this
dangerous ecclesiastical power could be checked. The rule of Anda,
though technically based on that law which gave the succession to the
tribunal, was not a typical instance of the government of the
audiencia, nor did that period present all the features of such a rule.
The influence of the audiencia as a body was practically <i>nil</i>.
Anda governed because he was a strong man, not because he was sole
<i lang="es">oidor</i> or because he was lieutenant-governor. His
government was virtually a dictatorship, based on military power, but,
nevertheless, just and benevolent. His extra-judicial actions met with
the king&rsquo;s approval, because they were efficient.</p>
<p>History will show that the Audiencia of Manila assumed temporary
charge of the government because the distance and isolation of the
colony rendered such a course necessary and because it was thought that
the audiencia was best fitted to assume control. The government by the
audiencia in the Philippines was not an isolated incident, but was
typical of the entire Spanish colonial empire. Owing to the conditions
which we have noted, and judged by the standards which constitute
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href="#pb361" name=
"pb361">361</a>]</span>good government, the rule of the audiencia was
neither successful nor satisfactory. Its most far-reaching defect, as
far as the relations of the audiencia and the governor were concerned,
lay in the wholesale exercise of administrative and military functions
by the magistrates of the audiencia. This impaired the quality of their
services as impartial magistrates and contributed in most cases to an
insatiable thirst for power. The magistrates were loath to surrender
the exercise of these governmental activities on the accession of the
succeeding governor, the audiencia displaying a marked tendency to
continue in the exercise of administrative control. This, then, was a
decided cause of strife and dissension between the audiencia and the
governor. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name=

Moses, <i>The Spanish dependencies in South America</i>. 1, 221. The
Council of the Indies manifested its disapproval of the acts of the
audiencia and of Pizarro by commissioning Pedro de Gasca as president
of the Audiencia of Lima. Gasca was ordered to restore that viceroyalty
to the sovereignty of Spain, and to do whatever the king would do under
like circumstances. This was in May, 1546. &ldquo;He (Gasca) was at the
head of every department of the administration,&rdquo; writes Professor
Moses; &ldquo;he might raise troops, appoint and remove officers, and
declare war; he might exercise the royal prerogative of pardoning
offenses; and was especially commissioned to grant an amnesty to all
who had been engaged in the rebellion. He was authorized to revoke the
ordinances which had caused the popular uprising and the overthrow of
Blasco N&uacute;&ntilde;ez; and, returning to the earlier practice, he
might make repartimientos, or confirm those which had been previously
made. In accordance with his expressed wish, he was granted no specific
salary, but he might make any demands on the treasuries of Panama and
Peru.&rdquo; <i>Ibid.</i>, I, 225.</p>

audiencia was created at Compostela, Nueva Galicia, in 1548. This
tribunal bore the same relation to the audiencia and viceroy in Mexico
as did that of Santa F&eacute; de Bogot&aacute; to those in Lima. The
Audiencia of Nueva Galicia had both judicial and administrative
functions, exercising its jurisdiction over the <i lang=
"es">partidos</i> and <i lang="es">corregimientos</i>, with their
respective <i lang="es">alcaldes</i> and <i lang="es">corregidores</i>.
It concerned itself, moreover, with projects of conquest, discovery,
the development of mines, and internal improvement. Subsequently this
audiencia was transferred to Guadalajara and given that name. See

is interesting to note that in 1564, while the Audiencia of Mexico was
governing <i lang="la">ad interim</i>, the voyage of Legaspi and
Urdaneta was undertaken, and the first permanent settlement was made in
the Philippines by authorization of that tribunal. Bancroft (<i>History
of Mexico</i>, II, 599&ndash;600) is both indefinite and inaccurate in
his account of the expedition of Legaspi and Urdaneta to the
Philippines. He says: &ldquo;Finally on the 21st of November, 1564, the
squadron sailed, and after a prosperous voyage, reached Luz&oacute;n,
where Legaspi founded the city of Manila.&rdquo; It is well known that
Legaspi did not sail directly to Luz&oacute;n, as Bancroft implies, but
he visited a number of islands in the Archipelago before he settled at
Ceb&uacute; on April 27, 1565. Manila was not formally claimed until
May 19, 1571 (Montero y Vidal, <i lang="es">Historia general</i>, I,
39; Mart&iacute;nez de Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, <i>An historical view</i>,
113&ndash;119). Bancroft (<i>op. cit.</i>, II, 743) states that Manila
was founded in 1564 by Miguel de Legaspi. Manila was a prosperous
commercial center before the Spaniards came to the Islands. Dr. James
A. Robertson in his article entitled &ldquo;Legaspi and Philippine
colonization&rdquo; (see American Historical Association, <i>Annual
report, 1907</i>, I, 154), states on the basis of original documents
that &ldquo;this well-situated and busy trade center was erected into a
Spanish city on June 3, 1571, and on the 24th the necessary officials
were appointed.&rdquo; Dr. Robertson states in a note (p. 154) that
&ldquo;possession was taken of Luzon, June 6, 1570.&rdquo;</p>

Acu&ntilde;a designated Almansa to supervise military affairs instead
of Oidor Maldonado, who was in reality senior magistrate, and as such
should have assumed the direction of military affairs in accordance
with the practice elsewhere, and in compliance with the laws of the
Indies. The <i lang="es">fiscal</i> objected to this illegal procedure,
as he termed it, alleging that the governor was not authorized by law
to choose his own successor. He pointed out that, according to the
existing laws, the senior magistrate should succeed to the military
command by his own right, without the interference either of the
governor or the audiencia. Notwithstanding this protest, Almansa
continued to hold the post of acting captain-general, for which it was
said that he was better fitted than Maldonado.</p>

Audiencia to Felipe III, July 6, 1606, Blair and Robertson, XIV,
140&ndash;148. These demands were ultimately met by a subsidy from the
treasury of New Spain. It may be remarked in this connection, that the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> were probably interested in somewhat more than
increased revenue for defense, since they were known to have been
absorbed in commercial ventures. This episode marks the beginning of a
struggle on the part of the Manila merchants for increased trading
privileges&mdash;a battle which continued until the close of the
eighteenth century. They were opposed by the merchants of C&aacute;diz
and Seville, and it was in the interest of these last-mentioned cities
that the Manila trade was restricted (Royal order of November 10, 1605,
and King to the Audiencia, February 6, 1606, A. I.,
105&ndash;2&ndash;1).</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

Although the laws of the Indies forbade the <i lang="es">oidores</i>
from trading (<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n,</i>
2&ndash;16&ndash;59, 60, 62, 64, 66), and the correspondence of the
period shows that the <i lang="es">oidores</i> were at first denied
trading privileges, (King to Conde de Monterrey, April 14, 1597; A. I.,
105&ndash;2&ndash;1), they were allowed to send to Spain sufficient
cloth, silk and other dress materials for their own use and for that of
their families (<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>,
2&ndash;16&ndash;63). This last-mentioned privilege was abused,
however, until the right of each official to send only a limited amount
of cargo on the galleon was generally recognized. For example, the
cargo list of the galleon &ldquo;Trinidad&rdquo; in 1753, shows that
ministers were assigned six <i lang="es">boletas</i>, or bales, of the
nominal value of 125 pesos each&mdash;that being only half the amount
usually allowed. This reduction, effected by Governor Arand&iacute;a,
caused much opposition on the part of the audiencia (<i lang=
"es">Expediente</i> of January 30, 1754; A. I., 108&ndash;3&ndash;11).
The officials having first claim on the right to send goods in the
galleon were those of the municipal <i lang="es">cabildo</i> of Manila.
On March 27, 1714, they were conceded the right to ship 132 <i lang=
"es">fardillos</i>, the specifications of which were not given. It was
mentioned, however, in the <i lang="es">consulta</i> which recommended
this bestowal that this was a re-enactment of the grant of 1699, and
that it was the policy of the king to be generous to the <i lang=
"es">regidores</i> in this matter because they were not given salaries
(A. I., 68&ndash;2&ndash;8). The royal order of June 30, 1786, bestowed
on the <i lang="es">regidores</i> the right to ship one ton of goods.
This right was confirmed by the <i lang="es">consulta</i> of October 7,
1789 (A. I., 105&ndash;3&ndash;5). The <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i>
of April 25, 1803, conceded five <i lang="es">boletas</i>, each valued
at one hundred pesos, to each <i lang="es">regidor</i>. The <i lang=

<i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> (A. I., 106&ndash;2&ndash;15).</p>

Marqu&eacute;s de Cerralbo. He was well known in the Philippines, where
he had formerly resided and married the daughter of an influential
resident. He held the temporary governorship about a year. It was
during his administration, and through his efforts, that the first
Spanish expedition was made to Formosa, Silva having ordered the
<i lang="es">alcalde mayor</i> of Cagay&aacute;n to land there with a
military force and establish fortifications. This was done; thereupon a
large number of Dominican friars sought and obtained permission for the
spiritual conquest of the Island. Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga says that the
latter &ldquo;exerted themselves with such zeal, that in a short time
they built several towns, and were able to number the greater part of
the natives among the professors of our faith&rdquo; (<i>ibid.</i>, I,

magistrates in a special report to the king on July 30, 1626. He stated
that Messa was &ldquo;an upright judge, and zealous in the service of
your Majesty.&rdquo; His comments on the other three were as follows:
&ldquo;Geronimo de Lagaspi does what his two sons wish, whom, on
account of their reckless lives, the governors cannot employ, and thus
they are unable to satisfy their father, who is not contented except
with favors. Don Juan de Valderrama does as his wife says; and Don
Matias Flores, although a young man, is less harmful;... He makes all

to the community, which is always disturbed by him&rdquo; (Silva to

Chapter VIII, note 16. On June 30, 1716, Torralba forwarded an
elaborate memorial to the king, showing that the finances were in an
excellent state, a net gain of 38,554 pesos having accrued to the
treasury since the beginning of the audiencia&rsquo;s rule. On the day
that this report was filed there existed in the treasury, according to
Torralba&rsquo;s figures, a favorable balance of 294,000 pesos. This
report contains the following interesting data: Income from the
subsidy, 250,000 pesos; betel monopoly, 13,167 pesos; tributes, 109,152
pesos; royal auctions, 20,377 pesos; <i lang="es">medias anatas</i>,
16,373 pesos; <i lang="es">almojarifazgo</i>, 20,377 pesos; wine
monopoly, 14,000 pesos (Report of Torralba on Financial Affairs, June
30, 1716, A. I., 68&ndash;4&ndash;18). In a letter dated July 8, 1716,
Torralba reported his compliance with the <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> of October 10, 1713, by means of which the king
had appealed for a &ldquo;free gift or contribution on the part of the
inhabitants of the Islands to assist in putting down a Catalonian
conspiracy.&rdquo; Torralba stated that the audiencia had seen to the
fulfillment of this command and had collected the sum of 7,042 pesos
(Torralba to King, July 8, 1716, A. I., 68&ndash;4&ndash;18).</p>

Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, who was favorable to the rule of the churchmen,
writes: &ldquo;There never appeared less confusion at an insurrection
than on the present occasion, every individual seeming satisfied with
his lot in being relieved from unjust oppression and violence. The
archbishop, who had assumed the reins of government, was the only
person whose mind was not at ease; but in a short time he was restored
to tranquillity by the arrival of a royal order, enjoining him to
suspend the Governor from his office, and imprison him; replace the
Royal Audience on the same footing as before; set at liberty
Se&ntilde;or Velasco (an <i lang="es">oidor</i> who had been imprisoned
by Torralba), and assume the reins of government himself, which was
exactly what had been effected by the late
disturbance.&rdquo;&mdash;Mart&iacute;nez de Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga,

showed its disapprobation of the rigorous acts of Cuesta by demoting
him from his place as Archbishop of the Philippines to the minor post
of Bishop of Mechoac&aacute;n in New Spain (Montero y Vidal, <i lang=
"es">Historia general</i>, I, 432). The assumption of the government by
Cuesta invited the suspicion that he had been a party to the murder of
the governor. Seven archbishops had already ruled on various occasions
in New Spain (Bolton, <i>Guide</i>, 469&ndash;470). It is surprising
that such an attempt to solve this problem was not made earlier in the
history of the Philippines.</p>

Rojo (Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, <i>An historical view</i>, II, 89).

Montero y Vidal (<i lang="es">Historia general</i>, II, 67; see, also,
note 114, Blair and Robertson, XLIX, 176) summarizes the life and
character of Archbishop Rojo as follows: &ldquo;This prelate was more
imbecile than traitor.... His obstinacy in submitting the Islands to
the dominion of the English; his struggles against Anda ... his
absolute ignorance of his powers ... his pardonable ignorance of
whatever concerned the military defense of the archipelago, his calm
submission to whatever the English advised, even in matters clearly
opposed to the integrity and interests of Spain ... give an exact idea
of the capacity and character of the unfortunate one who had the
misfortune in such an anxious time to exercise a command for which he
was lacking in intelligence, valor and in all other attributes
necessary to its successful accomplishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote">Le Gentil (<i>Voyage</i>, II, 252) characterizes
him as follows: &ldquo;Archbishop Rojo was a capable man for the
management of finances; he was clever in business and very zealous for
the service of the king; but he did not understand anything of military
affairs; ... he was between two fires, and being of an irresolute
disposition, he did not know which way to turn, ... besieged on one
side by <i lang="es">oidores</i>, on the other side by monks, he would
not (otherwise) have waited till the English were on the
assault.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote">Charges of indecent living and riotous conduct were
made by Anda in his various letters to the Archbishop. While the
English were at the gates of the city, the prelate was passing his
hours with indecent women. Anda stated that Rojo alternated between the
dance-hall and the pulpit, leaving to others the question of defense.
Anda stated that Rojo had allowed himself to be influenced by the
traitorous Santiago de Orenda&iacute;n, refusing to listen to the more
loyal counsel of the king&rsquo;s ministers (Blair and Robertson, XLIX,
132&ndash;160).</p>
<p class="footnote">Francisco Leandro de Viana, the <i lang=
"es">fiscal</i>, believed that the archbishop neither wished to be a
traitor to the king nor to his country, but he asserted that he (Viana)
was the only person in the colony who was so charitable in his opinion.
He felt that Rojo&rsquo;s stand was a result of his incapacity,
timorousness, irresolution and ignorance. Viana, like Anda, commented
on the archbishop&rsquo;s lasciviousness and immorality (Viana to Rojo,
March 1, 1763, A. I., 107&ndash;3&ndash;2).</p>
<p class="footnote">Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, the ecclesiastical historian,
seeing through priestly eyes, affirmed that Rojo was guilty of only one
error during his rule. This was his engagement to pay four millions of
pesos to the English and to deliver up the Islands to them
(Mart&iacute;nez de Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, <i>An historical view</i>,
II, 239).</p>

news of the temporary suspension of hostilities reached him in July,

British or of the archbishop. He held out until the arrival of the new
governor, Francisco Xavier de la Torre. See Anda to Rojo, July 29,

between England and Spain was signed on February 10, 1763. Notice had
been served on Anda several times that suspensions of military
operations had been authorized, but the <i lang=

overtures of the British. The Spanish troops under Anda&rsquo;s command
entered Manila on June 10, 1764, and the British forces evacuated the

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER X</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE AUDIENCIA AND THE CHURCH: THE ROYAL PATRONAGE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The audiencia was frequently brought into contact with
the powerful ecclesiastical organization in the Philippines. We have
already referred in this book to some of the notable occasions of this
relationship. Before the establishment of the audiencia the church
exercised an extensive authority in governmental affairs. The
ecclesiastics aided the civil government by administering justice in
the provinces when there were no civil courts. The prelates of the
Islands, the provincials of the religious orders and even the friars
advised the governors and provincial officials on Indian affairs and
the administration of the <i lang="es">encomiendas</i>. When the advice
of the church was solicited by the home government as to the
advisability of removing the audiencia, the suggestions of Fray Alonso
S&aacute;nchez and Bishop Salazar went far toward bringing about a
final solution of the problem of government in the
Philippines.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13648src" href="#xd21e13648"
name="xd21e13648src">1</a> These were some of the ways in which the
influence of the church was impressed upon the audiencia.</p>
<p>The creation of an audiencia, with judicial and advisory functions,
put an end to the exercise of these extraordinary powers by the church
and tended to confine its activities to the ecclesiastical field.
Nevertheless, the prelates continued to advise the governors in
administrative matters throughout the entire history of the Islands.
Their influence was especially strong in matters relating to the
natives, their government and protection, and the archbishops even went
so far at times as to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href=
"#pb363" name="pb363">363</a>]</span>give advice on questions of
foreign policy. Most of the time this counsel was solicited and was
well received. From 1650 onwards, as we noted in the last chapter, the
church waxed exceedingly strong in the Philippines and the prelates not
only advised, but dominated governors and audiencias. In 1668, Governor
Diego Salcedo was unseated, imprisoned and exiled by the commissary of
the Inquisition, while a pliant magistrate of the audiencia took over
the government and administered affairs in a manner entirely
satisfactory to his ecclesiastical supporters. The period from 1684 to
1690 showed the weakness of the audiencia when opposed by a powerful
prelate allied to a hostile governor. And in 1719 the church reached
the climax of its power by bringing about the murder of a governor, and
then succeeding him, overcoming every opposing element in the colony,
including the audiencia. From that time onward the prelates governed
during vacancies in the governorship&mdash;something which the
audiencia had failed to do. Finally, in 1762, Sim&oacute;n de Anda y
Salazar assumed the reigns of government and the obligations of
defense, an act which was sanctioned technically because he was an
<i lang="es">oidor</i> but really because he was an able man, capable
of accomplishing what the church had failed to do.</p>
<p>In this chapter it is not our purpose to review the historical facts
of the relations of the audiencia and the church or the growth of
clerical influence over the audiencia. These matters have been referred
to in earlier chapters. It is rather the design to study here the
influence which the audiencia, in its turn, exercised in ecclesiastical
affairs, noting whence it derived its authority and what was the nature
of its powers.</p>
<p>The audiencia was established as the ultimate local authority,
co-ordinate with the governor (or the viceroy in New Spain or
Per&uacute;), for enforcing the laws of the royal patronage.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13668src" href="#xd21e13668" name=
"xd21e13668src">2</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href=
"#pb364" name="pb364">364</a>]</span>Not only was it authorized to act
as a tribunal in these matters, but also to officiate as an active
executive agent. It is clear that although the governor was the royal
vicepatron, he was not expected to act alone and unsupported in dealing
with the powerful and often hostile ecclesiastical authority. In former
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name=
"pb365">365</a>]</span>chapters of this treatise attention has been
given to the considerations which forced him to share the duties and
responsibilities of government, finance, commercial supervision, and
even military affairs with the audiencia; the support of that body was
even more necessary in dealing with the powerful ecclesiastical
organization.</p>
<p>The authority which the audiencia exercised jointly with the royal
vicepatron was based upon the law ordering</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">our viceroys, presidents, <i lang="es">oidores</i> and
governors of the Indies to see, guard, and fulfill (the laws), and in
the provinces, towns, and churches (in the Indies) to see that all laws
and pre-eminences which pertain to our royal patronage are guarded and
fulfilled, ... which they will do by the best means that may appear to
them convenient, giving all the orders and instructions necessary to
the end that all (the instructions) that we may give shall be carried
out in due form; and we <i>pray and charge</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13730src" href="#xd21e13730" name="xd21e13730src">3</a> our
bishops and archbishops, deans, and ecclesiastical chapters of the
metropolitan and cathedral churches and cathedrals and all the curates
and occupants of benefices, clerics, sacristans and other
ecclesiastical persons, and the provincials, guardians, priors and
other religious of the orders, in so far as it is incumbent upon them,
to guard and fulfill them (the laws and pre&euml;minences of the king)
and see them fulfilled and obeyed, conforming with our viceroys,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span>presidents, audiencias and governors as much as
may be appropriate and necessary.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13738src"
href="#xd21e13738" name="xd21e13738src">4</a></p>
</div>
<p>In accordance with this law the audiencia exercised the right of
intervention in practically all matters to which the authority of the
vicepatron extended. Foremost among these were the supervision and
administration of ecclesiastical revenues, the administration of vacant
benefices, the extension of missionary influences and the construction
of churches and monasteries. The audiencia, moreover, had authority
over the reception and installation of prelates, parish priests, and
regulars, and their removal for cause. In all these matters the
audiencia was responsible directly to the king and made reports
thereon; in fact, it may be said that the tribunal, in co-ordination
with the vicepatron, served as a connecting link between the church in
the Islands and the royal council in Spain.</p>
<p>An analysis of the relations between the audiencia and the church
will show that the tribunal exercised two kinds of ecclesiastical
powers. These may be regarded respectively as executive and judicial.
Although it was in their union that the audiencia exercised its most
extensive and far-reaching power of ecclesiastical control, it is
advisable for several reasons that these powers should be considered as
distinct from one another. They will therefore be discussed separately
in this treatise. In this chapter we shall consider only the first of
these powers&mdash;the one which was most directly concerned with the
maintenance of the royal patronage&mdash;namely, the authority which
the audiencia exercised co-ordinately with the governor in the
supervision and control of the church in the colony.</p>
<p>Although there appears to have been no conflict of authority between
the governor and the audiencia over their mutual relations under the
laws of the royal patronage, it is advisable at the outset to settle
one difficulty which may present itself in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name="pb367">367</a>]</span>this
connection. Many of these powers which the audiencia exercised were
conferred upon the vicepatron exclusively. Indeed, a study of the laws
alone would suggest the possibility of a conflict of jurisdiction
between the governor and the audiencia in matters relating to the royal
patronage. In actual practice, however, the governor shared the powers
of ecclesiastical supervision with the audiencia, and their relations
were harmonious in all matters appertaining thereto. Indeed, there is
record of fewer conflicts between the audiencia and the governor in
this field of activity than in any other.</p>
<p>It would seem that the intervention of the audiencia in
ecclesiastical matters developed in the same manner and for the same
reason as it came to have authority in matters of government, finance
and military administration. The manifest impossibility of the
successful administration of the many affairs of civil and
ecclesiastical government by the governor (or viceroy in New Spain and
Per&uacute;) made inevitable the division of power, which, though real,
was not always formally recognized by the laws. The audiencia was the
only body available with which the governor (or viceroy) might share
these responsibilities. Its judicial character, and the talent,
training, and administrative ability and experience (wider than that of
the governor himself) of its members made it the logical institution to
which the executive should naturally turn for advice and assistance.
Not only did he require counsel, but the moral and physical support of
a tribunal of weight and authority was invaluable in dealing with the
united forces of a powerful ecclesiastical hierarchy. This is the best
possible explanation of that gradual assumption of authority by the
audiencia which seems to have been so indefinitely, yet freely
conceded, and which apparently grew up neither in conflict with the law
nor yet entirely in accord with it, but which, now recognized, and now
ignored, was never denied or prohibited. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb368" href="#pb368" name="pb368">368</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of October 6, 1578, in
explanation of the various forms of address in the expedition of royal
<i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i>, was designed to make clear the
respective jurisdictions of the vicepatron and the audiencia in
ecclesiastical as well as in other governmental affairs. It ordered
that</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">when our royal <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> refer
in particular to the viceroys, they alone shall attend to their
fulfillment without other intervention; if they designate the viceroy,
or president or audiencia, they shall all attend to their execution in
accordance with the opinion of the greater part of them that are in the
audiencia, and the viceroy or president shall not have more than one
vote like the rest that may be present, provided that this do not
contravene the superior government which we regularly commit to our
viceroys and presidents.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13769src" href=
"#xd21e13769" name="xd21e13769src">5</a></p>
</div>
<p>While more than a joint authority with the vicepatron cannot be
claimed for the audiencia, and that authority not necessarily coequal,
this <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> established beyond question the
royal intention of recognizing the audiencia as a support and an aid to
the governor. This law applied to all the affairs of government, not
pertaining any more extensively to the ecclesiastical than to the
administrative sphere, but this <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i>,
together with what actually happened, may be taken as evidence that the
audiencia was meant to have jurisdiction in ecclesiastical affairs when
royal <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> granting or assuming the exercise
of such jurisdiction were addressed to it.</p>
<p>The right of the officials of the civil government to interfere in
questions of patronage was seldom seriously questioned by the
churchmen, although there were some notable instances in which
religious authorities objected to this exercise of power. Bishop
Salazar, in his opposition to the plan of Fray Alonso <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name=
"pb369">369</a>]</span>S&aacute;nchez at the court of Madrid
(1593&ndash;1595), expressed his disapproval of the interference of the
governor and audiencia in questions of patronage. His opposition is
further attested by several of his letters and declarations enunciated
previous to that time.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13798src" href=
"#xd21e13798" name="xd21e13798src">6</a> He admitted that the civil
government, by virtue of the bulls of Alexander VI and Julius II,
should act as the defender and champion of the church, but he opposed
any further participation in ecclesiastical affairs by the civil power.
Salazar&rsquo;s arguments are worth noting because they were advanced
during the formative period of the Islands&rsquo; history. It was
during his prelacy that the basis of all future relations of church and
state was established. The arguments of Bishop Salazar were repeated
with little variation by Archbishop Poblete in his controversy with
Governor <span class="corr" id="xd21e13801" title=
"Source: Solcedo">Salcedo</span> in 1665 and later by Archbishop Pardo
in 1686.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13804src" href="#xd21e13804" name=
"xd21e13804src">7</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href=
"#pb370" name="pb370">370</a>]</span></p>
<p>In considering this question, the calm and impartial judgment of a
scholar is eminently preferable to the passionate arguments of a
prelate deeply concerned in the outcome of the dispute. Let us turn
from the field of original research to a modern Spanish writer on
church history and law. Fray Matias G&oacute;mez Zamora, writing from
the vantage ground of the modern day, characterizes the acts of the
government officials of the earlier era as excessive and unjustified by
papal bull or ecclesiastical canon. He even goes a step farther when he
declares that &ldquo;many royal decrees and <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dulas</i> were wrongfully issued, without proper
basis.&rdquo; He cites examples to prove his contention and among these
he points to the foundation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href=
"#pb371" name="pb371">371</a>]</span>of churches and monasteries by
civil authorities without the confirmation of the prelate, alleging
that such practices were entirely illegal.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13830src" href="#xd21e13830" name="xd21e13830src">8</a> In like
manner, he criticises the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> of October
19, 1756, and of June 24, 1762, which bestowed upon the governor
jurisdiction as vicepatron,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13841src" href=
"#xd21e13841" name="xd21e13841src">9</a> with the right of settling
whatever questions might arise. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;it
is clear that the viceroys, the audiencias and the governors did not
have, nor could they have spiritual jurisdiction over the persons or
property of the ecclesiastics, because in no case can power which is
delegated be greater than he to whom it is delegated.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13847src" href="#xd21e13847" name=
"xd21e13847src">10</a> Thus does this distinguished writer attack the
foundation of the entire institution whereby Spain controlled the
church in her colonies during a period of three hundred years.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the governor was the civil head of the
church in the colony, it would be possible to fill this chapter
completely with quotations of laws which were addressed to the
audiencia in recognition of its right of intervention in ecclesiastical
matters. The necessity of reserving space for specific cases
illustrative of history and practice permits only a scanty summary of
the most important of these laws. In practically all these cases the
audiencia participated conjointly with the vicepatron. The
interposition of the audiencia was authorized in the calling of
provincial councils and synods, and the resolutions of these bodies had
to be examined by the viceroys, presidents, and <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> to see that they were in accordance with the laws of
the royal patronage.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13857src" href=
"#xd21e13857" name="xd21e13857src">11</a> The audiencia <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name="pb372">372</a>]</span>was
empowered to examine all papal bulls and briefs and to suspend those
which had not been properly authorized by the Council of the Indies.
Disputes between prelates and arguments of churchmen based on bulls and
briefs were to be referred by the audiencia to the Council of the
Indies. The audiencia was authorized to enforce all properly authorized
bulls and briefs and to exercise care that the ecclesiastical courts
were granted their proper jurisdiction in accordance with canon
law.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13867src" href="#xd21e13867" name=
"xd21e13867src">12</a></p>
<p>The audiencia was authorized to enforce the law which forbade laymen
to trade with priests. Punishment in the latter case was not meted out
by that tribunal, but the offending churchmen were handed over to the
prelates.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13874src" href="#xd21e13874" name=
"xd21e13874src">13</a> The audiencia, viceroy, and governors were

<p>The following brief summary of laws of the early period, although
possibly repeating data already given, shows the extent of the
participation of the audiencia in the regulation of ecclesiastical
affairs:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13921src" href="#xd21e13921" name=
"xd21e13921src">20</a></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">All ecclesiastics holding office were first to gain
the recognition of the viceroy, president, audiencia or whatever
authority might be in charge of the province.</p>
<p>A list of the members of each order was to be furnished by their
provincial to the governing authority. Any changes subsequently made in
the membership of the orders had to be reported in the same way.</p>
<p>The names of all religious teachers were to be submitted to the
audiencia, governor or other authority in control, for inspection and
approval.</p>
<p>The audiencia was instructed to inform itself relative to the
efficiency of the clergy and of religious teachers working among the
Indians, and to see that those lacking in educational qualifications or
in general capacity were not permitted to enter the Islands.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13935src" href="#xd21e13935" name=
"xd21e13935src">21</a></p>
<p>Notices of removals or of new appointments made among the clergy
were to be sent to the governor, audiencia, and to the bishop.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13942src" href="#xd21e13942" name=
"xd21e13942src">22</a></p>
</div>
<p>The jurisdiction of the audiencia under the royal patronage extended
to practically all classes of churchmen and church affairs.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13947src" href="#xd21e13947" name=
"xd21e13947src">23</a> By the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> of August
4, 1574, and of October 25, 1667, the audiencia acquired the right of
passing on the credentials of prelates who came to the Islands. That
tribunal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name=
"pb374">374</a>]</span>was entrusted with the duty of seeing that
bishops and archbishops carried with them the duly attested
confirmation of the Council of the Indies, and no prelate was allowed
to leave the Islands unless he had the permission of the governor or
audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13957src" href="#xd21e13957"
name="xd21e13957src">24</a> The tribunal exercised a check on the
governor in this particular and saw to it that in granting this
permission he did not show favoritism or otherwise violate the laws of
the royal patronage.</p>
<p>Two striking illustrations of the audiencia&rsquo;s jurisdiction
over the inspection of the credentials of the prelates and higher
churchmen occur in the history of the <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e13964" title="Source: Phillipines">Philippines</span>. In 1674,
Francisco de Pal&oacute;u, a French bishop who had been engaged in
missionary work in China, was cast upon the shores of the Philippines.
The audiencia immediately dispatched orders for his detention, and he
was not permitted to return to his district on the ground that his
presence and jurisdiction in China constituted an encroachment on the
rights of Spain. China had been conceded to Spain by Alexander VI, and
by virtue of the royal patronage, the right of making ecclesiastical
appointments and the exercise of jurisdiction there were prerogatives
belonging to the Spanish crown.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13967src"
href="#xd21e13967" name="xd21e13967src">25</a></p>
<p>A similar case occurred in 1704, when Archbishop Tour&oacute;n,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name=
"pb375">375</a>]</span>a French delegate destined for China, arrived in
Manila. He was received by the governor and audiencia, as he bore a
legally executed commission from the pope for the visitation of all the
churches in the Orient, and for the settlement of all ecclesiastical
controversies which had arisen there. The royal <i lang=
"es">acuerdo</i> considered that the dispatches and credentials which
he carried were in accordance with the law. Tour&oacute;n was
accordingly permitted to set up an ecclesiastical court. He suspended
Archbishop Camacho from his office and freed from prison some of the
worst criminals in the Islands. He ordered the regulars to submit to
diocesan visitation; but they refused to obey him since they had
already rejected the efforts of the archbishop to enforce the
principle. The Council of the Indies ultimately disapproved of the
admission of this foreign ecclesiastic without the authorization of the
Spanish government<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13986src" href=
"#xd21e13986" name="xd21e13986src">26</a> and as a consequence ordered
the removal of the governor and senior <i lang="es">oidor</i>, heavily
fined the remaining magistrates and reduced Archbishop Camacho to the
position of Bishop of Guadalajara.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13994src"
href="#xd21e13994" name="xd21e13994src">27</a></p>
<p>In its joint capacity as assistant to the vicepatron and as a high
court with jurisdiction over ecclesiastical cases, the audiencia
settled disputes between rival claimants to positions of authority in
the church, particularly to the position of archbishop. The law which
had been in force up to 1619 prescribed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb376" href="#pb376" name="pb376">376</a>]</span>that the
ecclesiastical chapter should fill the vacancy with a temporary
incumbent, but some effort had already been made to have the senior
bishop succeed to the post. Bishop Arce of Ceb&uacute; was opposed to
this plan on the ground that each prelate had more than he could do in
the proper administration of his own bishopric.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14010src" href="#xd21e14010" name="xd21e14010src">28</a>
Nevertheless it may be noted that on January 22, 1630, Arce was made
acting archbishop of the metropolitan see of Manila by virtue of the
<i lang="es">acuerdo</i> of the audiencia and the vicepatron.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14016src" href="#xd21e14016" name=
"xd21e14016src">29</a> Arce&rsquo;s accession to the post was in
accordance with a papal bull which had been promulgated with the
king&rsquo;s approval at some date between 1619 and 1630. There had
been a three-cornered fight between the ecclesiastical chapter, the
Bishop of Ceb&uacute;, and the Bishop of Nueva Segovia, and this
conflict had been settled by the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> in favor of
Arce, while the chapter appealed to the Council of the Indies. When
Guerrero, the new appointee, arrived, he immediately laid claim to the
office, which Arce refused to surrender on account of an irregularity
in the archbishop&rsquo;s appointment. Arce appealed to the audiencia,
but the tribunal refused to authorize any innovations.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14032src" href="#xd21e14032" name=
"xd21e14032src">30</a> In a statement to the king, dated October 17,
1655, he related that in 1629 the governor and audiencia had solicited
that he come to Manila and take the place vacated through the death of
Archbishop Serrano. This would seem to indicate that the audiencia had
acted solely on the basis of its authority derived from the royal
patronage, but in settling the dispute among the various ecclesiastical
authorities it also acted judicially. Guerrero&rsquo;s credentials
finally came, apparently executed in the proper form and they were
referred to the audiencia by the governor. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377" name=
"pb377">377</a>]</span>tribunal, when it had satisfied itself that the
commission was valid, placed thereon the stamp of its approval and
accepted Guerrero as archbishop. Then the latter, in the words of
Governor Corcuera, presented himself &ldquo;in the royal court of
justice (the audiencia) before which he appeared to be presented [to
his see], he swore upon the gospels not to interfere with your
Majesty&rsquo;s jurisdiction, to respect your royal patronage, and to
be always your royal vassal.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14037src" href="#xd21e14037" name="xd21e14037src">31</a> In other
words, he took his oath of office as archbishop in the audiencia.</p>
<p>The above may be considered as a typical case of the temporary
designation of a prelate for the archbishopric of Manila by the
audiencia. To cite further instances of a similar nature would be
unnecessary. The tribunal continued to inspect the credentials of
bishops and archbishops before they were admitted to their posts
throughout the history of the Islands. This practice was followed even
during the period from 1660 to 1762 when the church counted for more as
a political institution than either the audiencia or the
governor.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14043src" href="#xd21e14043" name=
"xd21e14043src">32</a></p>
<p>The audiencia exercised intervention in the removal of curates from
their parishes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14057src" href="#xd21e14057"
name="xd21e14057src">33</a> As noted, already, these removals were made
by the vicepatron upon the recommendation of the prelate concerned. Of
course, when the audiencia was governing <i lang="la">ad interim</i> it
made these removals itself. It also intervened when the vicepatron was
present on occasions when he requested <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb378" href="#pb378" name="pb378">378</a>]</span>the support of the
tribunal or failed to act himself. The judicial authority of the
audiencia, exercised through its entertainment of appeals from curates
who had been removed, will be considered in the next chapter.</p>
<p>A great many reasons for removals were purely ecclesiastical, such
as questions of the private lives and conduct of priests and friars and
their insubordination and non-compliance with ecclesiastical or
monastic rules. With these matters the audiencia did not concern itself
unless deportation was involved, or the offenses of the priests
constituted crimes against the civil government. There is record of
many removals from curacies because of infractions of the marriage laws
by priests, such, for instance, as uniting heathen Chinese with
Christian women, which was a violation of the pragmatic law of March
23, 1776. Such cases, and indeed all which had to do with removals from
curacies after 1795, were settled by ecclesiastical tribunals with
appeal to the papal delegate, without the intervention of the
audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14070src" href="#xd21e14070"
name="xd21e14070src">34</a></p>
<p>The operation of the removal of regulars for cause was slightly
different. Unless the regular was the holder of a parish and subject to
episcopal visitation, the prelate had no jurisdiction over him, and
neither the governor nor the audiencia could interfere in the matter,
unless such intervention was requested by the provincial.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14080src" href="#xd21e14080" name=
"xd21e14080src">35</a> When the deportation of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name=
"pb379">379</a>]</span>regulars not holding curacies was decreed, the
consent of the vicepatron or audiencia, acting for him, was necessary.
This was usually given on the recommendation of the provincial, and the
exile accordingly became an act of the civil government. The formal
consent of the Council of the Indies was necessary for all deportations
of this character, but the complete exercise of this prerogative
gradually devolved upon the vicepatron, who notified the Council of the
act.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14102src" href="#xd21e14102" name=
"xd21e14102src">36</a></p>
<p>The crimes of priests or ecclesiastics against the law and order of
the realm were punishable in the same manner and by the same agency as
the simpler violations of ordinary subjects. Attention has already been
given in another part of this treatise to a case in which the
audiencia, in 1617, tried and punished six Augustinian friars who had
been convicted of murder.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14109src" href=
"#xd21e14109" name="xd21e14109src">37</a> Their guilt was first
ascertained by a preliminary investigation within the order, after
which they were handed over to the audiencia.</p>
<p>The statement has been made above that the audiencia was not allowed
to interfere in the internal r&eacute;gime of the convents or
monasteries.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14114src" href="#xd21e14114"
name="xd21e14114src">38</a> However, when the provincials of the orders
were unable to keep the friars in subordination they frequently called
upon the civil government for support and assistance. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name="pb380">380</a>]</span>This
was done in 1715 when the Castilian Recollects rebelled against their
provincial, incorporated themselves into a separate chapter, and
entrenched themselves in the convent at Bagumbayan, outside the Manila
wall. Oidor Torralba, then acting as governor and vicepatron, came to
the support of the provincial upon appeal. He cannonaded the
recalcitrants, arresting and imprisoning them on their surrender, and
finally banished their leaders.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14121src"
href="#xd21e14121" name="xd21e14121src">39</a> On this same occasion,
it may be noted, the provincial solicited the aid of the archbishop,
whose interference the rebellious friars had resisted as an attempt at
episcopal visitation.</p>
<p>The disciplinary jurisdiction over priests and friars referred to
above suggests a similar authority which the audiencia exercised over
the prelates. Within the period of one year after the installation of
Archbishop Guerrero at Manila in 1636, the governor, with the support
of the audiencia, had banished this same prelate and his ecclesiastical
provisor,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14132src" href="#xd21e14132" name=
"xd21e14132src">40</a> condemning the former to pay a fine of 2000
ducats. The governor contrived also to influence the
judge-conservator<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14144src" href=
"#xd21e14144" name="xd21e14144src">41</a> to pronounce a ban of
excommunication upon them both, in return for a like censure that had
already been passed on the governor by the prelate.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e14152src" href="#xd21e14152" name="xd21e14152src">42</a> The
banishment of Archbishop Poblete by Governor Salcedo and the audiencia
prior to the arrest of that governor by the commissary of the
Inquisition, the exile of Archbishop Pardo in 1684, and the
imprisonment of Archbishop de la Cuesta by Governor Bustamante and the
audiencia in 1719, are incidents <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381"
href="#pb381" name="pb381">381</a>]</span>in the history of the Islands
which serve well as illustrations of the disciplinary and coercive
jurisdiction of the vicepatron and audiencia over the churchmen. These
events need only be referred to here, as they have already been
discussed in relation to other phases of the history of the
audiencia.</p>
<p>As visitors of the provinces, the <i lang="es">oidores</i> were
required to inspect the ecclesiastical work of the parish priests and
to note their care and treatment of the Indians.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14162src" href="#xd21e14162" name="xd21e14162src">43</a> In the
exercise of these duties they were protected by a law which forbade
prelates to proceed against them with censures while they were carrying
on such investigations. Le Gentil, the noted French traveller, who
visited the Islands during the middle of the eighteenth century,
testified that the <i lang="es">oidores</i> did not fulfill their duty
with great faithfulness. Le Gentil stated that on account of their
dependence on the hospitality of the priests when travelling from place
to place in the provinces, the visitors&rsquo; inspections were merely
perfunctory and of little value.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14170src"
href="#xd21e14170" name="xd21e14170src">44</a></p>
<p>The above testimony is not corroborated, however, by the report of
Oidor Francisco Guerela who was sent to Camarines in 1702 to take
account of tribute and to inquire into the state of the <i lang=
"es">encomiendas</i>. He reported that in the curacies which were
administered by the Franciscans there was an entire absence of
religious instruction, the natives were mistreated, and they were
permitted to continue in idolatry, drunkenness, and superstition.
Neither the priests nor the <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> exerted
any uplifting or civilizing influence. The <i lang="es">alcaldes
mayores</i>, it was alleged, connived with the priests to defraud the
natives by the imposition of excessive tribute and by the exaction of
all sorts of fraudulent ecclesiastical tithes. The <i lang=
"es">oidor</i> in this case sought to remedy this state of affairs by
dispatching reformatory edicts against the friars, and by posting
notices and copies of royal decrees and <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i>
designed to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382" name=
"pb382">382</a>]</span>inform the natives of their rights under the law
and to warn them against the imposture of the friars. Whereupon the
Franciscans appealed to the Bishop of Camarines and persuaded him to
excommunicate the <i lang="es">oidor</i> on the grounds that he had
usurped the ecclesiastical jurisdiction. This appeal to the papal
delegate was in direct violation of the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i>
mentioned above, protecting such visitations against ecclesiastical
censure. The <i lang="es">oidor</i> appealed to the audiencia and that
body solicited the prelate by <i lang="es">ruego y encargo</i> to
remove his censures. The audiencia would go no further, however, as two
of the magistrates were personally hostile to Guerela, hence the
<i lang="es">oidor</i> was obliged to remain in the provinces at the
mercy of the friars. After six months of isolation, Guerela, who was
broken in health, sent an appeal for aid to the king on June 20, 1702.
This memorial embodied a full account of his attempts to make necessary
reforms in the provinces subject to his visitation.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e14209src" href="#xd21e14209" name="xd21e14209src">45</a> It
was presented to the Council of the Indies on October 14,
1706.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14214src" href="#xd21e14214" name=
"xd21e14214src">46</a> Three observations might be made from this
incident. First, there was little vigor, promptitude, or effectiveness
in the Spanish judicial system as therein exemplified. It took four
years for this petition to be presented to the Council and considerably
more time for an answer to be made. Secondly, this affair shows to what
extent petty spite and private quarrels interfered with good government
and efficient administration. Thirdly, it illustrates the fact that the
entire civil government, including the audiencia, was very much under
the domination and influence of the ecclesiastics.</p>
<p>An inspection which was similar to that just described was made by
Oidor Jos&eacute; Torralba, in 1713, in the provinces of Albay and
Ceb&uacute;. Torralba was unable to complete his work, owing to his
recall to Manila, where he was obliged to resume his place in the
audiencia on account of the insufficient number <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name="pb383">383</a>]</span>of
magistrates present in the tribunal. It seems that in the provinces
subject to his visitation, the former charges of the Franciscans had
been turned over to the seculars, most of whom were natives. Torralba
reported that under the careless and incompetent administration of the
parish priests, the churches had gone to ruin and all Indian
instruction had been abandoned. In his report he commented unfavorably
on the stupidity and immorality of the native clergy, alleging that in
them lay one of the causes of the poverty and degradation of the
people. He recommended the restoration of the regulars.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14221src" href="#xd21e14221" name=
"xd21e14221src">47</a> Torralba&rsquo;s recommendations were not
followed. Either because of his hurried departure from the provinces
where he left his work unfinished, or because of the disinclination or
lack of authority of the audiencia and vicepatron, no definite steps
were taken at this time for the amelioration of the condition of the
people or for the reform of the clergy.</p>
<p>That the interests of the friars were vigorously and effectively
championed at the court is evidenced by the royal decree of June 14,
1714, which was dispatched not alone to the Philippines, but which was
made general in Per&uacute; and New Spain.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14229src" href="#xd21e14229" name="xd21e14229src">48</a> It
forbade the governors and audiencias using their authority as
vicepatrons to justify their interference with the interior
administration of the convents and monasteries of the orders, which it
was complained they were doing without authorization. This decree
particularly emphasized the principle which has already been set forth
in this treatise that the vicepatrons and audiencias should not concern
themselves with the discipline and punishment of friars not holding
curacies. The promulgation of this decree was brought about
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384" name=
"pb384">384</a>]</span>as a result of the efforts of the commissary of
the Franciscan order in Madrid.</p>
<p>Not only were the <i lang="es">oidores</i> required to inspect the
work of the parish priests, but the audiencia, in the exercise of the
royal patronage, was authorized to receive, assist, and supervise the
ecclesiastical visitors who came from Spain or Mexico, or were
designated from the ranks of the local clergy to inspect the
orders.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14240src" href="#xd21e14240" name=
"xd21e14240src">49</a> These visitors were also authorized to inspect
friars who were in charge of parishes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14245src" href="#xd21e14245" name="xd21e14245src">50</a> and when
on these tours of inspection they might be accompanied by the prelate
in charge of the curacies retained by the friars under inspection. The
audiencia was to co-operate in all possible ways with these visitors,
and should any question arise between them and a prelate over
jurisdiction, the tribunal was to do everything possible to bring about
a harmonious adjustment of the points of difference. This is
illustrated by a case which arose in 1776, when Fray Joseph Pereyra was
given a royal commission to make a general investigation of the
Augustinian order in the Philippines. Fiscal Andrade of the audiencia
demanded that Pereyra should submit all his documents for inspection on
the basis of the royal patronage and other laws,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14248src" href="#xd21e14248" name="xd21e14248src">51</a> but the
audiencia, under the presidency of Governor Anda, refused to support
the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>. The king, on April 6, 1778, rebuked the
audiencia for its failure to support the royal patronage, citing two
<i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i>, those of July 2 and of October 14,
1773, respectively, in which he had already admonished the vicepatron
in that particular.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14260src" href=
"#xd21e14260" name="xd21e14260src">52</a> The failure of the audiencia
and governor to exercise all their prerogatives in support of the royal
patronage on these various occasions can probably be attributed to
dissensions within the tribunal and to the corrupting influence of the
church. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385" name=
"pb385">385</a>]</span></p>
<p>The statement has frequently been made in this treatise that the
audiencia served as a connecting link between the court and the colony.
It constituted a channel through which a large amount of correspondence
was carried on, and one of the duties most frequently required was that
of furnishing special and regular reports and <i lang=
"es">informaciones</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e14268src" href=
"#xd21e14268" name="xd21e14268src">53</a> on various subjects connected
with the church.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14295src" href=
"#xd21e14295" name="xd21e14295src">54</a> Notwithstanding the vast
number of ecclesiastics present in the colony, who could and did make
special and regular reports, and were indeed required to make them, the
audiencia was frequently called upon to render reports on precisely the
same subjects as those covered by the churchmen. In this way points of
view other than the ecclesiastical were obtained. Thus the advice of
magistrates, lawyers and men in active touch with the government served
to temper ecclesiastical opinion in the same way that the advice of
prelates exercised an influence on matters purely governmental. Taking
into consideration their position in the colony, the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> were better qualified to obtain and impart information
concerning the church than most authorities.</p>
<p>To indicate the vast field of special subjects in which the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> were required to report, various instances may be
mentioned. On July 1, 1598, the king desired information concerning the
alleged need of a greater amount of space on the galleon for the
support of the bishopric of Nueva Segovia. The archbishop and the
bishop of that diocese had both recommended that more cargo-space be
given to the church. The king <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386"
href="#pb386" name="pb386">386</a>]</span>desired to know whether, in
the opinion of the <i lang="es">oidores</i>, the privilege of shipping
two hundred tons would be sufficient for the needs of the bishopric in
question.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14313src" href="#xd21e14313" name=
"xd21e14313src">55</a> Again, on December 7, 1610, the audiencia was
called upon to forward to the Council of the Indies evidence bearing
upon a dispute between the natives of Quiapo and the Jesuits over lands
claimed by the latter society.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14316src"
href="#xd21e14316" name="xd21e14316src">56</a> On another occasion the
king requested of the audiencia a report concerning the work, deserts,
and financial condition of the convent of Santa Clara, which had asked
for royal aid.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14320src" href="#xd21e14320"
name="xd21e14320src">57</a> Frequently the audiencia was called upon to
take a census of the number of priests, secular and regular, in the
Islands and to report on the size of each order, the number of friars
holding secular curacies in each, and the number of
missionaries.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14323src" href="#xd21e14323"
name="xd21e14323src">58</a> It came to be its regular duty to furnish
these reports at stated intervals, and when, for some reason, it failed
to render them, a royal reprimand was forthcoming. A yearly report was
also made on the number of friars entering the Islands, how many had
gone to China, the number of souls ministered to by each order, how
large was each province, and how many people there were in each
curacy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14328src" href="#xd21e14328" name=
"xd21e14328src">59</a></p>
<p>It is interesting to know that the churchmen were also held
responsible for this information and that reports on these same
subjects were required of the prelates and provincials.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14335src" href="#xd21e14335" name=
"xd21e14335src">60</a> It is evident that the report of the audiencia
was utilized as a check to prevent misrepresentation on the part of the
friars, especially since it was always the object of each order to
prove that it was over-worked and in urgent need of more members. As
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name=
"pb387">387</a>]</span>friars were sent to the Islands at the royal
expense,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14342src" href="#xd21e14342" name=
"xd21e14342src">61</a> and as they were supported after their arrival
by the royal treasury, the exercise of economy was always desirable. On
the other hand, it was to the interest of an order to make its
requirements and accomplishments appear as great as possible.</p>
<p>Another function which the audiencia came to exercise by virtue of
its authority in behalf of the royal patronage was that of general
supervision over the colleges and universities. In the laws of the
Indies this duty was imposed upon the viceroys and governors,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14352src" href="#xd21e14352" name=
"xd21e14352src">62</a> and nothing was said of the authority of the
audiencia in that particular. According to the laws of the Indies, in
fact, the audiencia had little jurisdiction or authority over colleges,
universities and seminaries, but as the <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e14357" title="Source: administion">administration</span> of these
was entirely in the hands of the church, the audiencia came to exercise
much the same authority over education that it did over other church
activities.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14360src" href="#xd21e14360"
name="xd21e14360src">63</a> <i lang="es">Oidores</i> and <i lang=
"es">fiscales</i> were forbidden to act as rectors, but they might
participate in the law examinations to satisfy themselves whether the
standard of instruction in the royal universities and colleges was
sufficiently high, and whether the education, training and ability of
candidates for the licentiate&rsquo;s degree gave evidence of their
fitness.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14372src" href="#xd21e14372" name=
"xd21e14372src">64</a> According to the royal decree of November 27,
1623, the University of Santo Tom&aacute;s was founded in the
Philippines with the advice of the governor and <i lang=
"es">acuerdo</i> of the audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14380src"
href="#xd21e14380" name="xd21e14380src">65</a> Here again that tribunal
may be seen in the act <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href=
"#pb388" name="pb388">388</a>]</span>of assuming non-judicial functions
which primarily belonged to the governor through the unwillingness or
inability of that official to act alone.</p>
<p>The audiencia early exercised advisory powers in educational
affairs. The Jesuits as early as 1585 had requested permission to found
and establish a college or seminary in Manila, and the king, on January
11, 1587, requested of the audiencia a report on the general conduct,
progress and accomplishments of the Jesuit order, asking in particular
what benefit would accrue from the establishment of a Jesuit college in
Manila. The audiencia, in its report of June 25, 1588, characterized
their work as very effective, the learning and ability of their
personnel remarkable, but in the opinion of the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> there was scarcely any need of a college in Manila at
that time, and there were no means of supporting one.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e14392src" href="#xd21e14392" name="xd21e14392src">66</a></p>
<p>When Santo Tom&aacute;s became a royal university in 1648, the
Jesuits were obliged to sue in the audiencia for the right to continue
the bestowal of academic degrees. Their request was denied by the
tribunal, but the decision was reversed by the Council of the Indies in
1653.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14397src" href="#xd21e14397" name=
"xd21e14397src">67</a> On May 3, 1722, San Jos&eacute; was made a royal
college and was subjected to the visitation and patronage of the
audiencia. In 1769, when the Jesuits were suppressed, an attempt was
made to continue San Jos&eacute; as a secular institution under the
supervision of the audiencia. This brought forth such determined
opposition from the Dominicans <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb389"
href="#pb389" name="pb389">389</a>]</span>and from the friends and
supporters of Santo Tom&aacute;s that on June 30, 1778, a <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> was issued ordering the audiencia to close San
Jos&eacute; and hand over all students in attendance there to the
archbishop, so that they might be placed in secular colleges and
seminaries.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14411src" href="#xd21e14411"
name="xd21e14411src">68</a> This was done, and the audiencia rendered
to the Council of the Indies a report on the administration of the
finances pertaining to the transaction. The revenues derived from all
unsold properties belonging to the Jesuits were included in the
temporalities, and the income from these were transmitted to the royal
treasury. Subsequently the archbishop attempted to assume jurisdiction
over these Jesuit properties and funds, and to this the audiencia
objected. In 1784 the matter was finally settled by the decree of the
king in answer to an appeal which had been carried by the prelate from
the audiencia to the Council of the Indies. He sustained the audiencia
and forbade the prelate from interfering with these temporalities.</p>
<p>The Dominicans were more successful in the maintenance of an
educational institution.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14418src" href=
"#xd21e14418" name="xd21e14418src">69</a> On the occasion of the
extension of the charter of the <span class="corr" id="xd21e14424"

May 17, 1680, the king ordered &ldquo;my president and the auditors of
my Audiencia of that city, and request and charge the archbishop of the
city, the bishops of the said islands, the ecclesiastical and secular
cabildos, the superiors of the orders, and any other of my judges and
justices,&rdquo; ... to acknowledge the University of Santo
Tom&aacute;s as a beneficiary of the royal patronage. Its title was
formally extended on June 21, 1681, by act of the audiencia.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14427src" href="#xd21e14427" name=
"xd21e14427src">70</a> The tribunal not only exercised the right of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390" name=
"pb390">390</a>]</span>patronage over the Dominican university, but
also over the College of San Juan de Letr&aacute;n, a seminary for boys
which was founded in 1640 and maintained by the Dominicans as an
adjunct to Santo Tom&aacute;s.</p>
<p>Reports, recommendations, and <i lang="es">informaciones</i> exist
in abundance to prove that the audiencia exercised considerable
influence in the life and history of these institutions. The tribunal
celebrated <i lang="es">acuerdos</i> to improve the instruction in
mathematics, physics, law and medicine. It provided for the examination
of students, passed on their credentials, made regulations for the
bestowal of degrees and decided upon the fitness of prospective
teachers.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14440src" href="#xd21e14440" name=
"xd21e14440src">71</a> It supervised the records of these institutions,
audited their finances and sent reports to the king and Council
concerning the work of the universities and colleges. In its
jurisdiction and authority over these educational institutions the
audiencia served in behalf of the sovereign as his royal tribunal.
These were royal universities, endowed with special royal charters and
privileges and it was fitting that they should be controlled by the
royal audiencia in the king&rsquo;s name. In addition to this, as they
were administered by the church, the audiencia and the vicepatron
exercised joint control over them, in the name of the royal patronage
in the same manner that they supervised other ecclesiastical
activities. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name=
"pb391">391</a>]</span></p>
<p>As we have already noted, the audiencia exercised jurisdiction over
matters of church finance. The most notable examples of its control may
be seen in the administration of tithes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14468src" href="#xd21e14468" name="xd21e14468src">72</a> the
funds of temporalities, <i lang="es">obras pias</i>, funds of the
Crusade, and <i lang="es">espolios</i> of the prelates. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name="pb392">392</a>]</span></p>
<p>The audiencia was authorized to guard the royal interest in the
matter of the collection and the administration of tithes, particularly
with a view to seeing that over-ambitious churchmen did not obtain more
than their share, and that in the collection of the tithes they did not
oppress the natives. The special care of the <i lang="es">oidores</i>
was to see that tithes be not paid directly to the prelates.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14571src" href="#xd21e14571" name=
"xd21e14571src">73</a> In fact, these funds were to be administered by
the civil government, and prelates were not to be allowed to interfere
with their collection. No changes were to be made in the authorized
manner of collecting these funds on the responsibility of colonial
officials. Recommendations for reform should be made to the Council of
the Indies either by the prelate or by the audiencia.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e14576src" href="#xd21e14576" name="xd21e14576src">74</a> The
audiencia was ordered to see that the proper division and distribution
of tithes were made, and that the two-ninths of the gross sum collected
was duly set aside for the crown, in accordance with the law.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14581src" href="#xd21e14581" name=
"xd21e14581src">75</a></p>
<p>Further evidence that the audiencia was regarded as the instrument
of the royal will in these matters is afforded by the circumstances
leading up to the reforms of 1768 and 1786; and it should be noted
particularly that the king and Council relied <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href="#pb393" name="pb393">393</a>]</span>on
that tribunal for advice and assistance in the drafting and execution
of these measures. A number of tentative laws and proposals for changes
in the system of collection and administration of the tithes was sent
to the audiencia, from time to time, prior to 1768, and the magistrates
were required to submit opinions as to the availability and
applicability of the proposed measures. In 1768 a decree was issued
fixing the tithe at ten <i lang="es">reales</i> per Indian. Previous to
that year a number of religious orders owning large tracts of
agricultural land had refused to pay these taxes, and the audiencia, by
virtue of the royal order of September 25, 1768, was ordered to enforce
the law, which it did, even proceeding to the seizure of the chattels
of the recalcitrant friars.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14597src" href=
"#xd21e14597" name="xd21e14597src">76</a> On December 11, 1775, the
audiencia passed an ordinance diminishing the tithes to be paid by
natives, <i lang="es">mestizos</i>, Chinese and Japanese by one-half
<i lang="es">real</i> per person.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14607src"
href="#xd21e14607" name="xd21e14607src">77</a> On July 12, 1778, the
king asked the audiencia to submit evidence on the question of whether
the law worked any hardship on the inhabitants of the colony, and
whether <i lang="es">encomenderos</i> and friars were paying their
share.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14618src" href="#xd21e14618" name=
"xd21e14618src">78</a> At the same time, and on the same date, the
royal approval was given to the <i lang="es">auto</i> which the
audiencia had enacted on December 11, 1775. The recommendations of the
audiencia were also largely followed in the decree of January 20, 1786,
which was merely a repromulgation of an earlier <i lang="es">auto</i>
of the audiencia, which ordered that tithes should not be collected
directly from the Indians unless the latter were owners of lands.
Otherwise they were to be collected from the landlords.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14627src" href="#xd21e14627" name=
"xd21e14627src">79</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href=
"#pb394" name="pb394">394</a>]</span></p>
<p>By subsequent laws the audiencia was temporarily deprived of its
jurisdiction over tithes. When the Philippine government was
reorganized in 1787 by the Ordinance of Intendants, many of the special
commissions which had been previously retained by the magistrates were
ceded to the superintendent of <i lang="es">real hacienda</i>. The
actual collection of tithes was made the duty of the superintendent by
<i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of October 6, 1792,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e14658src" href="#xd21e14658" name="xd21e14658src">80</a> but
because of its relation to the royal patronage the audiencia, in
practice, found it convenient to retain control. Governor Aguilar, who
was also superintendent of <i lang="es">real hacienda</i>, wrote to the
king on July 31, 1799,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14667src" href=
"#xd21e14667" name="xd21e14667src">81</a> alleging that there was no
reason why the audiencia should exercise this authority, when, by
virtue of its financial nature, this duty belonged to the
superintendent. He stated that the audiencia had been given this
jurisdiction when there had been no other authority for the collection
of tithes, but that as it was not a controversial matter, there was no
reason for the continuance of this condition. In the letter referred to
Aguilar stated that he had attempted to put his interpretation of the
law into execution, but in so doing had been opposed by the audiencia.
The answer to this appeal does not appear in connection with the
original, but the royal <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of April 21,
1803, restored to the audiencia jurisdiction over the collection of
tithes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14674src" href="#xd21e14674" name=
"xd21e14674src">82</a></p>
<p>It may be said, however, that with the creation of the
superintendency the audiencia was shorn of many of the miscellaneous
functions with which it had been formerly endowed. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name="pb395">395</a>]</span>The
funds of the temporalities, however, did not come under this category.
They were greatly augmented in 1767 when the Jesuits were suppressed,
and as was usual with such miscellaneous and unclassified duties, as
well as on account of the audiencia&rsquo;s relation to the royal
patronage, the administration of these funds came under the charge of
an <i lang="es">oidor</i> whose official title was &ldquo;administrator
of the funds of the temporalities.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14693src" href="#xd21e14693" name="xd21e14693src">83</a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the audiencia&rsquo;s share of direct control over
these funds was still considerable. On January 23, 1803, a <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> was issued ordering that the money of the
temporalities and <i lang="es">obras pias</i> should be put at the
disposal of the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> of the audiencia.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14707src" href="#xd21e14707" name=
"xd21e14707src">84</a> A report was submitted to that tribunal by
Superintendent Aguilar on July 20, 1804, in accordance with this
<i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i>. The report of Aguilar showed a balance
on hand of 151,625 pesos waiting to be sent to Spain by the first
transportation. In 1809, the jurisdiction of these funds was completely
restored to the audiencia, with the provision that the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> who acted as their administrators should receive a
three per cent commission. As the funds were constantly drawn upon, and
there were no further confiscations of property of this sort, they can
be accounted as of little importance, yielding practically no revenue
from that date. Owing to the continual appeals of the government for
money with which to defray the expenses of putting down the various
insurrections from 1808 to 1814 and subsequently, the funds of the
temporalities, like every other peso that came into the treasuries
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb396" href="#pb396" name=
"pb396">396</a>]</span>of the colonies, were sent to Spain as rapidly
as they were collected.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14721src" href=
"#xd21e14721" name="xd21e14721src">85</a></p>
<p>The audiencia also audited the accounts of the <i lang="es">obras
p&iacute;as</i>, though its jurisdiction over these funds was often
opposed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14790src" href="#xd21e14790" name=
"xd21e14790src">86</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href=
"#pb397" name="pb397">397</a>]</span>The chief foundations of the
<i lang="es">obras p&iacute;as</i> in Manila were the Santa
Misericordia and San Juan de Di&oacute;s. The wealth and power of the
Misericordia became so great,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14813src"
href="#xd21e14813" name="xd21e14813src">87</a> and so well did it
profit by the various immunities extended to it, that by the early part
of the eighteenth century it had become the object of the distrust and
envy of all classes of Manila society. It was chiefly disliked because
it had been permitted to utilize so much free space on the galleon.
Other inconveniences had arisen from its participation in trade,
wherein, possessed of so many advantages, it was enabled to derive
profits and benefits that were denied to competing merchants in the
colony. Complaints were made against it by certain religious orders,
merchants, treasury officials, <i lang="es">oidores</i>, and the
governor, himself. It <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href=
"#pb398" name="pb398">398</a>]</span>was the consensus of opinion among
these that the accounts of this society should be inspected by the
government, and, in accordance with these recommendations, a <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> was expedited, ordering the society to submit
its accounts to the audiencia for inspection and approval.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14834src" href="#xd21e14834" name=
"xd21e14834src">88</a></p>
<p>The suspicions of the general public were confirmed, and the popular
distrust increased when the inspection of Oidor Calder&oacute;n
revealed that the finances of the society had been carelessly kept, and
that the books contained numerous discrepancies. The scrutiny of the
<i lang="es">oidor</i> showed the existence of a deficit of 383,437
pesos; that is, the records called for property in the hands of the
society to the value of that sum which could not be found. The
Misericordia, in a series of protests, accounted for the discrepancies
by alleging that the audiencia had declared many of its debtors
bankrupt. Relief from the inspection was requested on the grounds that
the local feeling and the prejudice of the <i lang="es">oidores</i>
would cause them to be unfair to the society. It pleaded that the
inspection should be made by the chief accountant of the Council of the
Indies (<i lang="es">contador de cuentas</i>) once in five years. In
this request it was supported by the recommendation of this
official.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14853src" href="#xd21e14853" name=
"xd21e14853src">89</a></p>
<p>On April 19, 1755, the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of November 9,
1747, was modified on the basis of these protests, and in lieu of the
annual inspection of the <i lang="es">oidor</i> was substituted the
requirement that once in three years the Misericordia should submit its
own accounts.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14866src" href="#xd21e14866"
name="xd21e14866src">90</a> This brought forth a storm of protest from
the residents of Manila, headed by Governor Arand&iacute;a, who went to
some length to describe the abuses which had arisen in the past from
the unrestricted liberty which the Misericordia had enjoyed. He accused
the society of dishonest political practices, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name=
"pb399">399</a>]</span>interference with the government, bribery and
corruption. He said that behind its commercial operations there existed
a veiled scheme by which the church was seeking to monopolize the trade
of the Islands.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14873src" href="#xd21e14873"
name="xd21e14873src">91</a> The opposition of the governor and
residents bore fruit to the extent that a compromise was made in the
royal <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of February 21, 1759, which
restored the practice of having <i lang="es">oidores</i> inspect the
accounts of the Misericordia, though the examination was to be held
only once in five years. This, of course, was sufficiently lenient to
defeat the entire scheme. <i lang="es">Oidores</i> were forbidden to
interfere with the property of the society at any other time and in any
other manner.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14886src" href="#xd21e14886"
name="xd21e14886src">92</a></p>
<p>The Misericordia maintained a stubborn and vigorous resistance to
the principle of visitation by the audiencia, but as far as may be
judged by the data at hand, the law was not changed again, and the
audiencia continued to exercise supervision. That the audiencia was
prone to overstep its authority in the matter of these inspections is
shown by an incident which occurred in 1776&ndash;1777. In the regular
quinquennial inspection of the records of the Misericordia a number of
abuses were uncovered. The funds were found to have been carelessly
administered, and the books inaccurately kept, owing to the negligence,
incapacity, and corruption of the members to whom the funds had been
entrusted. Governor Sarrio, as vicepatron, appointed Oidor
Calder&oacute;n as receiver and administrator of the funds, with the
charge that the <i lang="es">oidor</i> should suspend all payments
until the accounts were straightened out. The Misericordia protested
and on April 25, 1778, the king ordered the governor and audiencia to
desist from further interference with the funds of the society, the
royal disapproval being based on the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of
February 21, 1759, which, while authorizing the inspection of the books
of the society, forbade any minister <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb400" href="#pb400" name="pb400">400</a>]</span>&ldquo;to interfere
with or interrupt said House in the administration or distribution of
its funds.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14901src" href=
"#xd21e14901" name="xd21e14901src">93</a></p>
<p>The <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of February 21, 1759, was
reaffirmed on repeated occasions when the Misericordia refused to
submit its books to the audiencia. The last law touching upon this
particular question was promulgated on August 2, 1787, when it was
decreed that the accounts, books, records, and work of the Misericordia
and its officials should be subject to the inspection of the
audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14909src" href="#xd21e14909"
name="xd21e14909src">94</a></p>
<p>Not only was the opposition of the Misericordia a source of dispute
between that society and the audiencia, but the matter of financial
inspection caused disputes between the audiencia and other officials
and departments of the government. The reforms of 1787 made trouble
between the superintendent and the audiencia. Since this was a
financial matter, the former claimed the right of auditing these
accounts, which the audiencia refused to concede for the reason that it
had always had supervision over these funds (when the right was
exercised by any secular authority). The question was definitely
settled by the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of January 22, 1803,
which ordered that &ldquo;the money of temporalities, pious funds, and
charitable societies should be put at the disposal of the <i lang=
"es">acuerdo</i>, and that if any matters relative to those branches
were then pending before the superintendent, they should be remitted at
once to the audiencia.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14922src"
href="#xd21e14922" name="xd21e14922src">95</a> This was accordingly
done by Governor (and Superintendent) Aguilar,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14925src" href="#xd21e14925" name="xd21e14925src">96</a> and
after that time the jurisdiction of the audiencia was no longer
questioned.</p>
<p>Shortly after the establishment of the <i lang="es">consulado</i> of
Manila in 1769, a bitter dispute arose between that body and the
audiencia for jurisdiction over cases involving the commerce of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name=
"pb401">401</a>]</span>the Misericordia. On the basis of the <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> of July 8, 1774, the <i lang="es">consulado</i>
claimed exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes involving trade which
arose between merchants. It advanced the contention that in all suits
involving losses of galleons the society should be considered in the
case of an individual merchant. The audiencia, basing its claims on the
royal patronage, declared the <i lang="es">consulado</i> to have
exceeded its powers, in assuming the jurisdiction described above, and
fined several of its members. The <i lang="es">consulado</i> appealed
the case, and in reply the king promulgated a <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> on June 7, 1775, declaring that neither to the
audiencia nor to the <i lang="es">consulado</i> belonged the
jurisdiction over such cases, but that they should be tried in first

"xd21e14954src" href="#xd21e14954" name="xd21e14954src">97</a> The
reasons assigned for this decision were that the <i lang=
"es">consulado</i> could not try such cases because merchants
constituted its membership and because the <i lang="es">fiscal</i> and
two <i lang="es">oidores</i> also belonged to its tribunal. Neither the
audiencia nor the <i lang="es">consulado</i>, accordingly, could
impartially try commercial suits between merchants and the
Misericordia; accordingly thereafter all evidence should be submitted
to the Council for special action.</p>
<p>The audiencia and the governor had supervision over <i lang=
"es">espolios</i> and vacant benefices.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14979src" href="#xd21e14979" name="xd21e14979src">98</a> When a
prelate entered into office it was his duty to file with the <i lang=
"es">fiscal</i> an inventory of all properties belonging to him at the
time of his advent to the diocese.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15000src"
href="#xd21e15000" name="xd21e15000src">99</a> On the occasion of his
death a treasury official was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402"
href="#pb402" name="pb402">402</a>]</span>designated to estimate and
administer the property left, pay the debts of the deceased churchman,
execute his will with regard to his property in accordance with the
law, and turn over the residue to the royal treasury. This process was
known as taking the <i lang="es">espolio</i>.</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">espolio</i> of a deceased prelate was taken,
according to the early laws, by an official of the royal treasury, who
was designated by the president for the purpose, and who officiated
under the supervision of the audiencia. The tribunal verified the
<i lang="es">autos</i> and substantiated the proceedings of the
agent.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15019src" href="#xd21e15019" name=
"xd21e15019src">100</a> Whether any modifications in the manner of
collecting, distributing or accounting for the funds or properties
derived from these <i lang="es">espolios</i> were made elsewhere is not
clear, but in the Philippines the abuses which arose in the settling of
these ecclesiastical estates and benefices made the personal
intervention of the <i lang="es">oidores</i> necessary on a number of
occasions. By royal <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of June 23, 1712, it
was ordered that in all the audiencias of the Indies the magistrate
next in rank to the senior <i lang="es">oidor</i> should be constituted
as the</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">private judge, who, with the concurrence of the
<i lang="es">oficiales reales</i>, should have jurisdiction over and
should proceed against, receive and collect all the products and rents
of the vacant archbishoprics and bishoprics until the day on which the
new prelates should take possession of their offices, proceeding with
full cognizance ... to the collection ... of whatever might be due, ...
with the assistance of the <i lang="es">oficiales reales</i> who in
this matter are subject to the royal audiencia.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15046src" href="#xd21e15046" name="xd21e15046src">101</a></p>
</div>
<p>By this same law the audiencias, viceroys, presidents and tribunals
were forbidden to interfere with this judge in the execution of his
duties, or to impede the execution or the law in any manner whatsoever.
The estates of prelates were thus placed on a basis similar to that
occupied by the properties of civilians, which, we have noted, were
administered by a special magistrate of the audiencia. This <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> also provided that all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403" name=
"pb403">403</a>]</span>money left as a residue, after the debts of the
prelates were paid, should be sent to the king for distribution.</p>
<p>In view of the above-mentioned law, the practice followed in 1715,
on the death of Bishop Gorospe of Nueva Segovia, seems to have been a
direct violation of the royal command, and somewhat different from the
usual method of settling the estates of prelates. As soon as Gorospe
died at Magald&aacute;n, Pangasin&aacute;n, the <i lang="es">alcalde
mayor</i> of the province sent immediate notification to the governor
and audiencia. The tribunal, in <i lang="es">acuerdo</i>, on the motion
of the <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, authorized the <i lang="es">alcalde
mayor</i> and the treasury officials to take the <i lang=
"es">espolio</i> of that prelate, which order was duly complied
with.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15079src" href="#xd21e15079" name=
"xd21e15079src">102</a> The audiencia also dispatched a formal
notification to Archbishop de la Cuesta and the metropolitan chapter,
designating the former as the ecclesiastical governor of the
bishopric.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15087src" href="#xd21e15087"
name="xd21e15087src">103</a></p>
<p>The significant feature of this <i lang="es">espolio</i> is that it
was taken by an official as inferior in rank as an <i lang="es">alcalde
mayor</i> through the express authorization of the audiencia, instead
of being conducted by the second magistrate of the audiencia as the law
directed. It is possible that the arrival of the <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> of June 24, 1712, had been delayed, or that this
may have been a case, so frequent in the Spanish colonies, of
compliance without obedience. Certain it is that the conditions of life
and travel in the provinces were of such a character that an <i lang=
"es">oidor</i> would have found it more comfortable to remain in the
capital and delegate the disagreeable duties of the <i lang=
"es">espolio</i> in a far-distant province to the resident <i lang=
"es">alcalde mayor</i>. Attention has already been called to various
complaints made by governors and others against the disinclination of
the magistrates to submit <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href=
"#pb404" name="pb404">404</a>]</span>to the inconveniences of
provincial inspections. Again, it is very probable that the time and
attention of the magistrate whose duty it should have been to take this
<i lang="es">espolio</i> were occupied with more important judicial
duties.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15116src" href="#xd21e15116" name=
"xd21e15116src">104</a></p>
<p>The citation or further multiplication of data relative to <i lang=
"es">espolios</i> would be monotonous and unprofitable. Sufficient has
been said already to show the extensive participation of the audiencia
in the administration and settlement of the estates of prelates and the
assignment and care of vacant benefices. It may be noted, however, that
the audiencia suffered little if any diminution of its authority over
the <i lang="es">espolio</i> through the Ordinance of Intendants. That
code deprived the <i lang="es">oficiales reales</i> and <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> of the duty, formerly incumbent on them, of taking
<i lang="es">espolios</i> and conferred it upon the intendants and
corregidor-intendants of provinces. However, it was still required that
the papers relative to the proceedings should be submitted <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405" name=
"pb405">405</a>]</span>afterward to the audiencia for legalization and
approval.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15179src" href="#xd21e15179" name=
"xd21e15179src">105</a> Appeals and cases of litigation arising from
them were to be settled in the audiencia. This decree made little
difference in the procedure in the Philippines, as the
corregidor-intendants were never instituted there, and the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> continued in the settlement of these matters, subject
to the designation of the superintendent, who, it will be remembered,
was also governor and president of the audiencia. The tribunal passed,
as always, on all acts of <i lang="es">espolio</i> and heard cases
affecting them on appeal. In this manner the properties of the prelates
were administered in a conservative and legal manner and the interests
of the crown were safeguarded.</p>
<p>The audiencia exercised joint authority with the vicepatron over
questions relating to the construction of churches and the conservation
of ecclesiastical property. No monastery, convent, college, hospital,
or other religious institution could be founded without the consent of
the king, and this permission was obtained through the viceroy,
governor, or audiencia upon the recommendation of the prelate of the
diocese.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15191src" href="#xd21e15191" name=
"xd21e15191src">106</a> The laws of the Indies conceded that matters
which did not admit of delay could be settled by the president and
audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15196src" href="#xd21e15196"
name="xd21e15196src">107</a> In fact, as early as August 15, 1620,
Governor Fajardo acknowledged receipt of a letter from the king in
which occurred the statement that &ldquo;no church or convent, not even
a chapel, ought to be, or can be, founded unless concurrent with your
permission, and that of the Audiencia.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15201src" href="#xd21e15201" name="xd21e15201src">108</a> It was
provided that all petitions of religious orders for permission to
construct convents and monasteries should be referred to the council,
with the recommendations of the audiencia, but in actual practice, when
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name=
"pb406">406</a>]</span>the advice of the audiencia was in the
affirmative, the vicepatron gave the desired consent, reporting on his
action to the Council of the Indies. Thus we see that the governor and
audiencia in reality exercised complete authority in uncontested
cases.</p>
<p>A large number of communications written to the audiencia by the
royal authorities exist, illustrating the nature and extent of the
influence of the audiencia in these matters. In 1604, the king learned
that the Augustinians of Cavite had founded a convent with no other
authority than that of the governor. This was contrary to the laws of
the royal patronage and the audiencia was ordered to correct the abuse,
and to see that the royal orders were obeyed in the future.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e15208src" href="#xd21e15208" name=
"xd21e15208src">109</a> On another occasion the audiencia was ordered
to correct certain abuses of the Jesuits, who had dispossessed the
natives of their lands and had built various structures thereon. The
lands were ordered to be returned to their rightful owners and the
buildings destroyed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15211src" href=
"#xd21e15211" name="xd21e15211src">110</a></p>
<p>The ambitions of the friars to construct monasteries, convents and
hospitals, and otherwise to manifest their powers and add to their
increasing strength had to be checked frequently. The audiencia was
called upon to do this throughout the history of the Islands. Possibly
the best illustration of the authority of the audiencia in these
matters may be noted in the part which it played in restraining the
Augustinians from the further extension of their influence during the
period from 1763 to 1778. The entire matter was summarized in the
<i lang="es">consulta</i> of the Council of the Indies dated December
10, 1777, and the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of April 6, 1778, with
unfavorable results for the Augustinians.</p>
<p>On November 17, 1770, the provincial of this order applied for
permission to construct a convent in Cavite and solicited an
appropriation of four thousand pesos for this purpose. It was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407" name=
"pb407">407</a>]</span>suggested that the money should be supplied
either by the income from vacant benefices or from the profits of the
sale of betel to the natives. The provincial laid special claim to
royal aid on the extraordinary justification that the convent of his
order at Im&uacute;s, Cavite, had been bombarded and destroyed by the
British in 1763. On August 16, 1772, the Council of the Indies referred
the matter to the Audiencia of Manila and the tribunal, after an
exhaustive investigation of the subject, recommended non-compliance
with the provincial&rsquo;s request. In its report, the audiencia
reviewed the former attempts of this order to extend its power and
influence. On December 2, 1765, it had tried to obtain permission to
construct a convent at Nagtaj&aacute;n, which the audiencia and Fiscal
Viana frustrated. The Augustinians tried again on February 20, 1766,
asking for permission to build at Bagumbayan. This plan the audiencia
was also able to defeat. On August 16, 1772, this same order, impatient
at the delay of the Council in answering its petition of November 17,
1770, and still persistent, solicited permission from the governor
alone, not alluding to the fact that a petition of this sort was at
that time pending before the Council of the Indies. This request was
considered in the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> with unfavorable
consequences for the Augustinians.</p>
<p>The report of the audiencia was forwarded to the court and was there
reviewed by Francisco Leandro de Viana, formerly <i lang=
"es">fiscal</i> of the Audiencia of Manila and at that time a member of
the Council. Viana recommended that not only should the desired
permission be refused but a rigid investigation of the legitimacy of
titles to properties held by the Augustinians should be made. He
regarded as especially reprehensible the deliberate effort on the part
of the provincial to obtain this permission from the governor in view
of the unfavorable attitude of the Council of the Indies and of the
laws ordering that licenses for the construction of convents should be
given only by the Council of the Indies, after consultation with the
prelate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href="#pb408" name=
"pb408">408</a>]</span>of the ecclesiastical district and with the
audiencia, governor, or viceroy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15236src"
href="#xd21e15236" name="xd21e15236src">111</a> In this way, due very
largely to the influence of the audiencia, the efforts of this order to
extend its authority were checkmated. This may be considered as a
typical case of the intervention of the audiencia in behalf of the
royal patronage.</p>
<p>It will be noted in another connection that the audiencia was called
upon, from 1680 to 1720, partly as a tribunal of justice and partly as
an agent of the royal patron, to investigate the titles of the lands of
the friars, and, by this proceeding, the tribunal deprived the orders
of much of the property which they had usurped.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15253src" href="#xd21e15253" name="xd21e15253src">112</a> It may
also be noted that an <i lang="es">oidor</i> regularly inspected the
royal hospital at Manila,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15262src" href=
"#xd21e15262" name="xd21e15262src">113</a> and when prelates and
curates were transferred from one district or parish to another,
property left by them was inventoried and taken under the direction of
the audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15267src" href="#xd21e15267"
name="xd21e15267src">114</a> These measures were designed to insure the
security and conservation of royal property.</p>
<p>In summary, it may be said that the audiencia possessed joint
authority with, but not equal to the vicepatron in the regulation and
supervision of religious affairs. As a tribunal, and as an agent of the
civil government, the audiencia supported and assisted the vicepatron.
At times, indeed, it acted in his stead. We have seen that the
audiencia labored in the interests of the royal authority when it
passed on the acts of provincial synods and councils, and it inspected
bulls and briefs before they were allowed to become operative in the
colony. It sought always to bring about a peaceful settlement
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409" name=
"pb409">409</a>]</span>of disputes between prelates, curates, and
religious orders. Acting in the interests of the civil government, the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> made inspections in the provinces, noting the
work of the friars and parish priests in their particular fields,
giving special attention to the treatment afforded to the Indians by
their ecclesiastical protectors. The tribunal acted as the patron of
the royal colleges and universities. It regulated the administration of
ecclesiastical finances, devoting especial attention to tithes,
<i lang="es">obras p&iacute;as</i> and <i lang="es">espolios</i>. And
finally, as we have just noted, it was endowed with considerable
authority in determining the advisability of authorizing the
construction of churches, monasteries, and convents, or of permitting
the orders to extend their influence in various parts of the colony.
The intervention of the audiencia in these matters was recognized by
the court at Madrid and by the ecclesiastics of the Philippines.

royal patronage in the Indies was based on the bulls of Alexander VI,
dated May 4, 1493, and November 16, 1501, and on that of Julius II,
dated July 28, 1508. By the first two bulls the temporal and spiritual
jurisdiction of the Indies was conceded to the monarchs of Spain and by
the last one the universal <i lang="es">patronato</i> was given. Aside
from the responsibilities of government, this concession involved the
duty of christianizing the natives and the right of collecting tithes
from them. By virtue of these papal bulls the Spanish rulers were
granted the right of nominating prelates for the Indies, the assignment
of benefices and provinces to the different orders, the confirmation of
minor ecclesiastical appointments, and, in fact, general supervision
and control over the regular and secular clergy in the colonies
(<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>, 1&ndash;6&ndash;1 to 7). By
these acts the pope was relieved of all direct responsibility for the
spiritual government of Spain&rsquo;s over-sea dominions, his authority
being limited to the approval of prelates nominated by the Spanish king
and to other ecclesiastical duties of a nominal character.</p>
<p class="footnote">The <i lang="es">patronato real</i> in Spain
furnished a precedent for that of her colonial empire. Although the
royal patronage in Spain and in the colonies were closely associated,
the beginning of this relationship may be found in the early years of
Spanish history, when concessions were granted by the king to nobles,
cities, and similarly, to churchmen, in exchange for fealty of some
sort. For example, the vast tracts of land in Spain were received by
the church as a gift from the state, wherefore the state reserved the
right to declare who should hold these lands and enjoy these privileges
and also the power to dictate the conditions under which they were to
be held. The right of appointment by the crown to vacant benefices and
to all the higher church offices were applications of this principle.
(See Cunningham, &ldquo;The institutional background of Latin American
history,&rdquo; in the <i>Hispanic American historical review</i>, Vol,
I, pp. 24&ndash;39.)</p>
<p class="footnote">The concession of 1501 by Alexander VI was only one
of a number of privileges of the sort accorded by the popes to the
Spanish crown. The emperor, Charles V, obtained from Pope Hadrian VI
the perpetual right to nominate prelates and abbots to vacant
benefices. In 1543 the Spanish government further demanded and received
the concession that all posts within the church in Spain and her
colonies should be held by Spaniards. In 1538 the right of the church
to issue bulls and briefs affecting the colonies was limited. In 1574
Philip II declared that the right of patronage belonged privately to
the king. As a result of this, says Professor Altamira, &ldquo;the
Spanish clergy considered itself more closely bound to the king than to
the pope, ... more dependent on the court than on the <i lang=
"es">curia</i>, ... more eager for the privileges of the crown than for
the rights of the church, ... the bishops were obliged to obey the
monarch more than the archbishop.&rdquo; (Altamira y Crevea, <i lang=
"es">Hist&oacute;ria</i>, III, 418&ndash;19.)</p>
<p class="footnote">The laws of the royal patronage centralized the
supervision and control of the clergy of the Philippines in the person
of the governor of the Islands. The latter was vicepatron and
representative of the king in ecclesiastical matters. He was the
responsible head of church affairs in the Islands so far as these
matters concerned the government. He was legally authorized and
required to receive and assign prelates, to confirm minor appointments
by the prelates to parishes and curacies, to make removals from the
same when necessary, to make temporary assignments of provinces to the
regulars and to support the prelates in the exercise of episcopal
visitation. His consent was necessary to the suppression, division, or
union of districts, curacies and parishes, and no priest could leave
the Islands without his consent. The king was patron, but the exercise
of his authority in the colonies was delegated to the respective
viceroys and governors. See entire title of <i lang=

Archbishop Pardo&rsquo;s well known opposition to the exercise of
governmental control on the basis of the royal patronage and his
resistance to the pretensions of ultimate superiority over the church
which the temporal government claimed and assumed are referred to in
another part of this treatise. In a letter written by the archbishop
relative to the ecclesiastical controversy bearing his name, Pardo made
the assertion that no person was more zealous to encourage or conform
to the royal authority than he, for he realized the necessity of
complete temporal jurisdiction over all things secular. He stated that
he had always encouraged the ecclesiastics to comply with the just
demands of the civil government, &ldquo;for it is just,&rdquo; he wrote
to the king, &ldquo;to observe the temporal things over which Your
Majesty has providence, since the secular power must be obeyed, ... yet
I cannot offend the royal person by allowing him or his servants to
transgress the rules or authority of God without interposing my
influence against it, even at the risk of being disgraced; ... while I
am allied to the civil authority in things secular, I am the superior
in spiritual matters.&rdquo; He continued: &ldquo;God has placed side
by side the ecclesiastical and temporal authorities and the latter were
intended to be subject to the former, and therefore, the temporal
ministers ought to cede to the spiritual, according to the rules of the
Holy Catholic Church. It is manifestly unjust, therefore, that a
governor, <i lang="es">maestre de campo</i>, or other royal official
should command or summon to justice a prelate who is charged with the
welfare of the souls of the people of his commonwealth&rdquo; (Pardo to
King, September 7, 1686, A. I., 68&ndash;1&ndash;44).</p>
<p class="footnote">A violent, though ineffective resistance was
maintained by the church when Governor Sim&oacute;n de Anda y Salazar
sought to abolish certain practices observed in the chanting of mass.
Anda based his action on his authority as vicepatron. In his stand he
was supported by the archbishop and by two suffragan bishops. However,
Bishop de Luna, of Camarines, who was also papal delegate, violently
opposed &ldquo;sending [a copy of] this scandalous mandate to the royal
Audiencia&mdash;a body consisting of three magistrates, to whom an
appeal may lie against the governor&rdquo; (Letter of a Franciscan
Friar, December 13, 1771, Blair and Robertson, L, 318&ndash;319.) That
a soldier should be the final arbiter in a question belonging so
pre-eminently to the ecclesiastical sphere, seemed to this bishop to be
entirely subversive of the interests of religion and he turned to the
audiencia for protection and support. The governor sent a squad of
soldiers to arrest the prelate, and the latter was forced to leave the
Islands.</p>
<p class="footnote">In 1770, Governor Anda was vehemently opposed by
the ecclesiastical authorities of the colony in his efforts, as the
churchmen described it, &ldquo;to interfere in the governmental and
judicial rights and pre-eminences of the church.&rdquo; This was during
the struggle over the question of episcopal visitation; in this matter
the governor supported the archbishop. The former had gone so far as to
declare that the friars had neither the right nor the authority to
administer the sacraments. The replies of Fray Sebasti&aacute;n de
Asunci&oacute;n, a Recollect, and of Antonio de San Pr&oacute;spero, of
the Augustinians, attacked the whole foundation of the royal patronage,
claiming that the church should be given entire control in
ecclesiastical matters. According to their views the attention of the
governor should be confined to administrative affairs (<i lang=
"es">Expediente de los provinciales de Filipinas, 15 de Julio,
1772</i>, A. I., 107&ndash;7&ndash;6). As these friars were the
provincials of their orders, their opinions are of value in reflecting
the ideas of the religious in the Islands on the subject of episcopal
visitation. These opinions were contrary to the accepted practices and
to the ideas of men of higher standing in Spain&rsquo;s colonial
empire.</p>
<p class="footnote">Archbishop Pardo&rsquo;s well-known opposition to
the exercise of governmental control on the basis of the royal

dispute concerning the jurisdiction of the audiencia over the findings
of synods arose in 1773 and again in 1776, when the Bishop of Nueva
Segovia protested against the ruling of the audiencia that all the
deliberations of a provincial synod which had been held in that
bishopric should be submitted for its approval. The bishop appealed to
the Council of the Indies and that body approved the action of the
audiencia (King to the <span class="corr" id="xd21e13861" title=

Illustrative of this same authority on the part of the audiencia and
the Council of the Indies was the <i lang="es">consulta</i> of the
latter tribunal, enacted January 22, 1781. The Audiencia of Manila had
called the attention of the home government to the fact that the
nomination of Fray Manuel de Obelar, a Dominican, to the post of
apostolic vicar of the province of Fukien, China, had been irregular
because it had lacked the formality of presentation by the Spanish
monarch. Other nominations, namely, those of 1753 and 1759, were cited
as examples wherein this formality had not been lacking. The Council of
the Indies recommended to the King that the nomination should be
accepted and that an <i lang="es">ayuda de costa</i> should be voted,
but that His Holiness should be notified through the Spanish ambassador
in Rome that in the future the requirements of the royal patronage
should be observed, and that no appointments in China, Spain, or in the
Spanish colonies should be made without the consent of the Spanish
monarch (A. I., 105&ndash;3&ndash;2).</p>

revoked many of the privileges of the Spanish friars there and forced
their retirement to Manila (<i lang="es">consulta</i> of the Council of
the Indies on the report of the proceedings of Cardinal Tour&oacute;n
in China, February 24, 1710, A. I., 68&ndash;2&ndash;8). That his

<i lang="es">consulta</i> of April 21, 1708, whereby 4000 pesos were
voted to defray the expenses of Tour&oacute;n in the Philippines and
China. This money was added to the Philippine subsidy in Mexico

<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>, 1&ndash;14&ndash;71 to 75; the
entire title (14) of this book deals with the general subject of the
religious orders. The method of procedure in such cases may be
illustrated by the efforts of the government to correct the abuses of
Fray Alonso Zamudio, an Augustinian, who was in charge of a parish, and
who therefore was subject to episcopal visitation. He was charged with
immoral and vicious conduct. The provincial of his order made an
investigation and reported that the evidence brought against him would
warrant his prosecution. He recommended the removal of the friar,
which, he stated, he could not himself bring about because Zamudio was
acting as a parish priest. The <i lang="es">provisor</i> of the
archbishopric recommended the banishment of Zamudio, which act was
carried out by the governor in <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> with the
audiencia. A <i lang="es">ruego y encargo</i> was dispatched by the
tribunal, soliciting the surrender of the friar. He was accordingly
handed over to the civil authorities and was incarcerated in Fort
Santiago until the sentence could be executed (<i><span lang=

<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>, 1&ndash;14&ndash;71, 72. An
illustration of the operation of this sort of banishment may be noted
in the case of three Augustinian friars whose deportation was requested
by their provincial. The request was ignored by Governor Anda,
whereupon the provincial wrote directly to the court; consequently on
April 13, 1777, the king ordered the audiencia to see that these three
friars were returned to Spain; Anda was advised to give more attention
in the future to matters pertaining to the royal patronage (King to the
Audiencia, April 13, 1777, A. I., 105&ndash;2&ndash;9).</p>

free of expense. The governors and viceroys were commanded to pay
particular attention to them, assisting and providing for them in all
possible ways. &ldquo;Until the members of the different orders were

Audiencia to Felipe II, June 25, 1588, Blair and Robertson, VI, 318.
The Jesuits, on July 8, 1598, again requested permission to bestow the
degrees of licentiate and doctor, urging that the distance from Europe
was so great that the universities there were inaccessible to students
of the Philippines. At that time the petition of the Jesuits was not
granted, but that order succeeded in getting permission to establish
the college of San Jos&eacute; in 1601. This institution was enabled to
maintain itself without royal aid until 1767. Its chief support was
derived from the immense wealth of the society and from the large
donations of individuals.</p>

college of Santo Tom&aacute;s was founded on August 15, 1619, eighteen
years after the foundation of the rival college of the Jesuits. Due
largely to the guiding influence and paternal care of a number of
Dominican archbishops it grew and prospered. It became a royal
university in 1645 and its title was extended at various times
subsequently (Montero y Vidal, <i lang="es">Historia general</i>, I,

number of <i lang="es">testimonios</i> exist in A. I.,
105&ndash;2&ndash;6 bearing on suits of natives and Chinese <i lang=

years they were admitted, but these institutions were primarily
intended for the children of Spaniards. Of especial interest was the
suit brought in the audiencia by the Chinese <i lang="es">mestizo</i>,
Francisco de Borja, against the University of Santo Tom&aacute;s for
the degree of master of arts, which the educational institution refused
to grant on account of the nationality of the plaintiff. The suit was
carried to the Council of the Indies, and that tribunal, after
requiring the opinion of the royal <i lang="es">fiscal</i>, declared in
its <i lang="es">consulta</i> of July 17, 1780, that the laws of the
Indies (<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>, 1&ndash;22&ndash;57)
denied to <i lang="es">mestizos</i>, Chinese, and mulattoes the right
of studying in the royal universities, but once having qualified,
however, there was nothing in the origin or nature of an infidel that
should prevent his receiving his degree (A. I., 105&ndash;3&ndash;1).
Another question which was deliberated with much care was whether
illegitimate children should be admitted as students or qualified as
licentiates.</p>

Ecclesiastical tithes (<i lang="es">diezmos</i>), according to
Mart&iacute;nez Alcubilla, were &ldquo;taxes upon the products of the
earth which the producers paid from the entire product of their labor,
without deduction of the expenses to which they were put, or
consideration of the capital invested&rdquo; (Mart&iacute;nez
Alcubilla, <i lang="es">Diccionario</i>, V, 412). Escriche defines the
ecclesiastical tithe as &ldquo;the part which is paid by the faithful
for the maintenance of the ministers of the church,&rdquo; usually
consisting of a tenth of their products, although at times it was less,
varying with the use and custom of the locality (Escriche, <i lang=
"es">Diccionario</i>, I, 638). This payment was required from
merchants, farmers and <i lang="es">encomenderos</i> (<i lang=
"es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>, 1&ndash;16&ndash;1 to 10). In 1537
Viceroy Mendoza was directed to exact tithes from the natives
(Bancroft, <i>History of Mexico</i>, III, 666). This was again ordered
by the <i lang="es">c&eacute;dulas</i> of July 12, 1778, and January
20, 1786 (A. I., 105&ndash;2&ndash;9). Subsequently the agricultural
estates of friars were made liable to the payment of tithes. As early
as 1655 the Jesuits in New Spain were obliged to pay tithes on all
crops and productions of their estates (Bancroft, <i>History of
Mexico</i>, III, 668).</p>
<p class="footnote">The purpose to which these funds were theoretically
devoted was the support and maintenance of the church. The right of
collecting and administering them was conceded to the crown by Pope
Alexander VI in the bull of November 16, 1501, in &ldquo;full, absolute
and irrevocable ownership, with the condition that the crown should
assist the church with a sum sufficient for the decent support of
divine worship, its prelates and ministers&rdquo; (<i lang=
"es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>, 1&ndash;16&ndash;1 and 23). The <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> of April 29, 1648 reaffirmed and amplified this
bull, ordering in addition that one-third of all money arising from
vacant benefices should be set aside for the support of the church,
while the residue should be sent to Spain (<i>ibid.</i>,
1&ndash;7&ndash;41; see also 1&ndash;16&ndash;28 and Article 8,
<i lang="es">Real Ordenanza de Intendentes de Buenos Ayres</i>;
Robertson, <i>History of America</i>, IV [Bk. viii], note XXXII).</p>
<p class="footnote">On February 3, 1541, Charles V prescribed that the
tithes should be divided into four equal parts, two of which were to go
to the prelate and chapter of the diocese, while the remaining two
parts were to be further separated into ninths (<i lang=
"es">novenos</i>), of which two were to be reserved for the crown,
three for the construction of churches and hospitals, two for salaries
of curates, and the remaining two portions were to be set aside to pay
the dignitaries and subalterns of the diocese (<i lang=
"es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>, 1&ndash;16&ndash;23).</p>
<p class="footnote">In case the portion reserved for the salaries of
curates proved insufficient, the royal treasury guaranteed a yearly
stipend of from one hundred to a hundred and twenty pesos to each
priest. This <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> was amended by the
regulation of March 28, 1620, which provided that the royal ninths
should be taken from the gross amount of tithes paid in (<i lang=
"es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>, 1&ndash;16&ndash;25). So it developed
that the crown came to assume entire jurisdiction over the
administration of the tithes, retaining a portion of these episcopal
rents for non-ecclesiastical purposes. The royal share was placed in
the treasury and was administered by the <i lang="es">oficiales
reales</i>, leaving only seven-ninths of the money actually obtained to
be expended for the support of the church. These funds were collected
in the provinces by the provincial revenue officials, subject to the
supervision of the <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i>, who were
responsible in turn for this particular matter to an <i lang=
"es">oidor</i> and a royal treasury official of the central government
(<i>Ibid.</i>, 1&ndash;16&ndash;1, 30).</p>
<p class="footnote">These <i lang="es">novenos</i> were not
infrequently farmed out in New Spain, and at the auctions thereof
frauds were as repeatedly committed as at the sales of other royalties.
Instructions were issued ordering the Audiencia of Mexico to
investigate the nature of these transactions. In March, 1728, the royal
<i lang="es">novenos</i> were leased for a period of nine years at
$19,000 annually. When this lease expired they were let again for a
similar period at $20,000 a year (Bancroft, <i>History of Mexico</i>,
III, 666&ndash;668 and note 57); see Priestley, <i lang=
"es">Jos&eacute; de G&aacute;lvez</i>, 249&ndash;253, for data on the
administration of tithes in New Spain.</p>

While the temporalities were originally the endowments of the sovereign
for the support of the clergy, in the Philippines at this time they
were chiefly derived from the sale of jewels, lands, live-stock, and
other chattel properties of the Jesuit order, which had been suppressed
in 1769. Property to the value of 2,000,000 pesos fell into the hands
of the government on this occasion. The temporalities did not include
convents, school buildings, colleges, churches and church furnishings.
The latter were turned over to the archbishop and the secular
church.</p>

very instructive and hitherto unexplored field of investigation lies in
the reports of the different officials and bodies in the colonies which
were entrusted with the duty of collecting and forwarding money to help
Spain in putting down the various revolts of the late eighteenth and
early nineteenth centuries. We may note the letter of Governor Aguilar,
dated July 20, 1804, in which he reported compliance with the royal
order of June 20, 1798, relative to the raising of money for the
purposes indicated. He had opened two public subscriptions for
&ldquo;voluntary offerings&rdquo; to aid in putting down the Catalonian
revolt of 1798. In the first subscription, 80,946 pesos were raised and
in the second, 15,397 pesos. The Dominicans alone gave 5000 pesos, the
magistrates of the audiencia, the members of the <i lang=
"es">consulado</i>, the <i lang="es">contadores</i>, <i lang=
"es">oficiales</i>, <i lang="es">reales</i>, <i lang="es">obras
p&iacute;as</i>, prelates, <span class="corr" id="xd21e14740" title=
"Source: temporalties">temporalities</span>, the <i lang=
"es">Compa&ntilde;ia de Filipinas</i>, the <i lang="es">monte pio
militar</i>, the veteran soldiers, religious orders and other
organizations and individuals each contributing their share. Aguilar
reported that subscriptions had been opened in all the provinces by the
<i lang="es">corregidores</i>, <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> and
<i lang="es">intendentes</i>. The various provinces and districts
contributed on this occasion as follows: Tondo, 11,059 pesos; Laguna,
2768 pesos; Ceb&uacute;, 300 pesos; Albay, 85 pesos; C&aacute;piz, 318
pesos; Leyte, 21 pesos; Antique, 4 pesos; Samar, 1090 pesos; Zambales,
41 pesos; Calamianes, 1607 pesos; Mindoro, 221 pesos. This money was
sent to the Viceroy of New Spain, and was forwarded to Spain by him
together with the remittances collected for the same purposes in that
viceroyalty. Reports of <i lang="es">alcaldes mayores</i> show that
these assessments (<i lang="es">contribuciones voluntarias</i> or
<i lang="es">directas</i>, or <i lang="es">donativos voluntarios</i>)
varied from half a <i lang="es">real</i> from the poorest Indian to
five hundred pesos from the wealthier landlords and merchants. In many
cases these assessments practically amounted to confiscations (Aguilar
to the King, July 20, 1804, A. I., 105&ndash;3&ndash;23).</p>
<p class="footnote">On June 18, 1806, the king acknowledged receipt of
money which had been confiscated from the common funds of the village
communities (King to Aguilar, June 18, 1806, A. I.,
105&ndash;2&ndash;18).</p>
<p class="footnote">Hume, in his <i>Modern Spain</i> (158), says that
in 1809 the colonies contributed 3,000,000 pounds sterling for the
relief of the home government. Priestley, <i lang="es">Jos&eacute; de
G&aacute;lvez</i>, 370&ndash;71, sheds some light on the matter of
these forced contributions in New Spain.</p>

Mart&iacute;nez Alcubilla, <i lang="es">Diccionario</i>, X, 719. The
<i lang="es">obras p&iacute;as</i> were charitable associations or
corporations, usually under ecclesiastical control, which were founded
and supported by persons who contributed or willed their money for
beneficent objects. In Manila there were two leading societies of this
character, the Santa Misericordia and San Juan de Di&oacute;s. The
former was a branch of a larger organization of the same name, which
had originated in Portugal, and was quite generally established
throughout Spain, Portugal and their colonies. A branch was founded in
Manila in 1596, with the object, as stated in the articles of
establishment, of erecting and maintaining a college for orphan
children, the support of the poor, and particularly of the orphans and
widows of soldiers. This society flourished from the beginning under
the favor of certain governors and <i lang="es">oidores</i> and by
their assistance and by that of other friends, and through the
endowment by the government of a large amount of free space on the
galleon, it became a wealthy and powerful institution. San Juan de
Di&oacute;s, which was organized as a brotherhood, was established in
the Philippines in 1617 with avowed charitable purposes. In the
<i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> of February 10, 1617, the king ordered
the audiencia at Manila to place the hospitals under the care of this
brotherhood (Blair and Robertson, XLVII, 164&ndash;165). Though it did
not attain the wealth or importance of the Misericordia and it never
had the extensive relations with the government of the other society,
it did exceedingly valuable work in the Islands, going far toward
accomplishing the purposes for which it was founded.</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14813" href="#xd21e14813src" name="xd21e14813">87</a></span> By
1660, the Misericordia had received in contributions the sum of 356,363
pesos. In 1619, the treasury at Manila had become so exhausted by the
expenses involved in resisting the Dutch that Governor Fajardo borrowed
from the society the sum of 39,599 pesos. Later Governor Corcuera
exacted a loan of 104,609 pesos. In all, up to 1670, an aggregate of
441,909 pesos had been borrowed from this wealthy society for the
current expenses of the government. In 1762&ndash;3 the Misericordia
contributed the sum of 195,588 pesos as tribute money to the British
and was, according to its own accounts, despoiled of 301,597 pesos,
making a total of 506,184 pesos, and leaving a balance of 193,246 pesos
(<i lang="es">Procurador de la Misericordia de Manila al Rey, 23 de
Julio, 1764</i>, A. I., 106&ndash;5&ndash;8).</p>
<p class="footnote">The capital of the Misericordia of Manila on
January 31, 1755, was estimated at 701,477 pesos (<i lang="es">Informe
del Contador de Cuentas, 31 de Enero, 1755</i>, A. I.,
106&ndash;5&ndash;8). In the occupation of Manila by the British and in
the loss and despoliation of property suffered thereby, the
Misericordia received a blow from which it never entirely recovered. By
July 20, 1804, the capital of the society had dwindled to 151,625 pesos
(Aguilar to the King, July 20, 1804, A. I., 107&ndash;5&ndash;29).</p>

the colonial bishoprics the temporary successor of a deceased prelate
was usually designated by the local diocesan chapter. If, as was the
case in the Philippines, the latter body were lacking, the archbishop,
by virtue of his position, became temporary ecclesiastical governor,
with jurisdiction over the revenues of the diocese. The benefice was
considered vacant until the appointment of a regular bishop.</p>

fairly typical example of an <i lang="es">espolio</i> was that of
Bishop Ar&eacute;valo of Nueva C&aacute;ceres, rendered by the
audiencia on July 19, 1759. The total sum left by that prelate was
19,000 pesos. The leading items of the <i lang="es">espolio</i> were:
costs, 1919 pesos; bequest to College of Santo Tom&aacute;s, 2000
pesos; bequest to the cathedral of Nueva C&aacute;ceres, 400 pesos;
bequest to the brother of the deceased, the Marquis of Monte Castro,
1000 pesos. The remaining portion was paid to creditors in sums varying
from 20 to 300 pesos, leaving something over 6000 pesos for the crown
(<i lang="es">Auto de Espolio, 20 de Julio, 1759, Audiencia de
Manila</i>, A. I., 106&ndash;4&ndash;16).</p>
<p class="footnote">On June 14, 1774, the audiencia reviewed the
<i lang="es">autos</i> of <i lang="es">espolio</i> of the Bishop of
Ceb&uacute;, the total of which aggregated 11,210 pesos. The papers
were duly forwarded to the <i lang="es">Contadur&iacute;a General</i>,
at Madrid, and were approved by that tribunal on June 20, 1778 (A. I.,
105&ndash;2&ndash;9).</p>
<p class="footnote">Owing to the anarchical conditions prevailing at
the time of the death of Archbishop Rojo, his <i lang="es">espolio</i>
had to be postponed until June 26, 1777, and the royal treasury
received 3078 pesos therefrom. The prelate left a valuable library to
the College of San Ildefonso in the city of Mexico, and 13,617 pesos in
money to be distributed among his personal creditors and heirs
(<i lang="es">Consultas del Consejo, 20 de Marzo, 1778</i>, A. I.,

<p class="footnote">The large sum of 12,000 pesos was netted to the
royal treasury by the <i lang="es">espolio</i> of Bishop Espeleta of
Ceb&uacute; on May 6, 1783 (A. I., 105&ndash;2&ndash;10). By way of
contrast, the fact may be noted that the <i lang="es">espolio</i> of
Archbishop Santos y Rufina yielded 92 pesos. (<i lang="es">Auto de

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE AUDIENCIA AND THE CHURCH: THE ECCLESIASTICAL
JURISDICTION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the same manner that the audiencia performed the
functions of a civil court, so did it exercise jurisdiction as a
superior tribunal or court of appeal over prelates, church tribunals,
and ecclesiastical judges. It will be our purpose in this chapter to
determine the relations of the audiencia with the various
ecclesiastical tribunals and to direct attention to the occasions on
which it acted as a court, either with original or appellate
jurisdiction in ecclesiastical cases.</p>
<p>In this particular phase of the investigation an effort will be made
to distinguish between the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the audiencia
and its acts relative to the royal patronage. Not only may this
distinction be made for conveniences of discussion, but it will be
readily seen that the character of the powers and jurisdiction
exercised was widely different. When acting as a tribunal of appeal
over prelates, provincials, and ecclesiastical courts the chief concern
of the audiencia was the administration of justice. When acting in
defense of the royal patronage, as noted in the preceding chapter, its
authority was primarily executive and administrative, designed always
to safeguard the interests of the civil government.</p>
<p>It is, of course, true that all the power exercised by the civil
government over the church proceeded from authority invested in the
former by the laws of the royal patronage.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15297src" href="#xd21e15297" name="xd21e15297src">1</a>
Nevertheless, it must be observed that there were times when the
audiencia exercised the function of an impartial, disinterested court,
with no aim or object other than that of maintaining simple
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb411" href="#pb411" name=
"pb411">411</a>]</span>justice. It may be conceded, for example, that
the authority which the audiencia exercised in the settlement of
disputes between religious orders and between the prelates and the
regulars partook of the same judicial character as the jurisdiction
which it had in settling disputes between civil corporations and
individuals. The intervention of the audiencia for the protection of
the Indians from the abuses of the churchmen,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15302src" href="#xd21e15302" name="xd21e15302src">2</a> its
entertainment of the <i lang="es">recurso de fuerza</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e15309src" href="#xd21e15309" name=
"xd21e15309src">3</a> and its function as a court of appeals for the
protection of the natives against ecclesiastical tribunals may be said
to have constituted acts in defense of the royal interests as well as
in securing the ends of common justice. In restraining church
authorities from the intemperate use of the interdict,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e15331src" href="#xd21e15331" name=
"xd21e15331src">4</a> or from a too liberal extension of the right of
asylum,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15343src" href="#xd21e15343" name=
"xd21e15343src">5</a> the audiencia was not seeking the ends
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb412" href="#pb412" name=
"pb412">412</a>]</span>of justice (though judicial proceedings were
instituted) so much as it was defending the royal prerogative and
protecting the officials of the civil government. This may also be said
of its efforts to prevent the abuse of power by the commissary of the
Inquisition. In these last-mentioned activities, therefore, the
audiencia may be said to have acted in defense of the royal patronage,
though in all these cases its method of procedure was that of a court
of justice.</p>
<p>The church in the Spanish colonies had its own judicial tribunals
for the trial and settlement of cases arising within it which did not
concern the civil government.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15355src"
href="#xd21e15355" name="xd21e15355src">6</a> The division of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413" name=
"pb413">413</a>]</span>authority between the civil and ecclesiastical
courts and the respective jurisdictions of each are described by
Professor Moses, who writes:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The courts of the civil government and not the
ecclesiastical authorities considered ... all questions involving the
limits of bishoprics, the rights and prerogatives of the holders of
benefices, controversies between ecclesiastical councils and their
bishops and archbishops concerning the administration of the Church,
all disputes between parish priests and their parishes, in a word, all
cases that in any manner touched the royal patronage. Even matters
spiritual and cases between persons of a privileged tribunal were not
excepted from the civil jurisdiction; but certain cases might be
brought before the viceroy, and, if desired, an appeal might be taken
from the viceroy&rsquo;s decision to the audiencia.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e15428src" href="#xd21e15428" name="xd21e15428src">7</a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href="#pb414" name=
"pb414">414</a>]</span></p>
<p>It will be our function in this chapter to determine the
participation of the civil courts in these matters.</p>
<p>The power of intervention in ecclesiastical matters which was
exercised by the civil tribunals was always a source of discord in the
Philippines. The attitude of the churchmen on this question is well
shown by a letter written January 20, 1688, by Fray Alonso
Laud&iacute;n, procurator in Madrid for the Franciscans of the
Philippines, in protest against the encroachments of civil government.
He wrote that</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">the principal causes of trouble in the Philippines are
the disagreements which continually exist between the royal audiencia
and the ecclesiastical judges; ... the ministers of the royal
audiencia, by virtue of the royal patronage of Your Majesty whom they
represent, ... hold ... that the audiencia has ecclesiastical
jurisdiction over the Church and over purely ecclesiastical persons,
over spiritual cases and the administration of the Holy Sacrament, ...
and spiritual and territorial jurisdiction in regular and secular
parishes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15442src" href="#xd21e15442" name=
"xd21e15442src">8</a></p>
</div>
<p>Laud&iacute;n described the helplessness of the ecclesiastical
judges and the ineffectiveness of their jurisdiction, circumscribed as
it was by that of the civil magistrates. He stated that all the
judicial acts of the ecclesiastical ordinaries were rendered null by
the magistrates of the audiencia and that the ecclesiastical
authorities were reduced to such a condition that they did not know
where to turn for relief or remedy, as even the papal decrees were
rendered ineffectual by the encroachments of the civil jurisdiction. He
stated that &ldquo;the ecclesiastical judges see in all this a meddling
and interference with the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, which has always
been allowed, but they cannot hereafter give fulfillment to the
provisions of the audiencia, even at the risk of expulsion from their
districts.&rdquo; Laud&iacute;n was of the opinion that the laws had
been misinterpreted by the civil officials and that the king had never
intended that the churchmen should be so entirely shorn of their
powers. He concluded his appeal with the solicitation that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415" name="pb415">415</a>]</span>such
laws should be made as would determine the questions at issue and bring
about harmony between church and state in the Islands. This should be
done, he said, &ldquo;in order that each may be caused to see clearly
the duties and jurisdiction which belongs to him and that each may
freely make use of his own powers and prerogatives, and thus avoid
suits and other disagreements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The laws of the Indies prescribed that the most harmonious relations
should prevail between the ecclesiastical and civil magistrates. The
audiencia was commanded to aid the prelates and ecclesiastical
magistrates in the exercise of their jurisdiction, neither interfering
with them nor permitting them to be molested by other civil
authorities.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15453src" href="#xd21e15453"
name="xd21e15453src">9</a> These laws, like those of the royal
patronage, not only gave to the civil government a commanding position
with relation to the church, but they established the magistrates as
the supervisors and guardians of the church courts.</p>
<p>It was the duty of the audiencia, on the other hand, to guard
strictly the prerogatives of the civil magistrates, and, in fact, those
of all officials of the government, and not to allow the ecclesiastics
to infringe on their jurisdiction through acts of <i lang=
"es">fuerza</i>, interdicts, or by any other illegal means.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e15466src" href="#xd21e15466" name=
"xd21e15466src">10</a> The ecclesiastical courts were forbidden to try
laymen or those subject in first instance to the jurisdiction of the
civil courts. They were forbidden to imprison private subjects, or
embargo or sell their property without first seeking the consent and
co-operation of the secular arm.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15471src"
href="#xd21e15471" name="xd21e15471src">11</a> They were forbidden to
try any cases except those involving the church, and they could not,
without the aid of the civil authorities, impose fines or condemn
persons to labor.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15477src" href=
"#xd21e15477" name="xd21e15477src">12</a> In general, they were
solicited to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416" name=
"pb416">416</a>]</span>work in harmony with the audiencia, and to give
all possible assistance to that body.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15485src" href="#xd21e15485" name="xd21e15485src">13</a> Wherein
doubt existed or where there was reason to believe that an action might
constitute an interference with the civil prerogative, the
ecclesiastical judges were ordered to ask the advice of the secular
authorities. The ecclesiastical and secular magistrates were enjoined
to aid each other actively when occasion demanded, the prelates
supporting the audiencia, and the latter dispatching provisions to its
magistrates and subdelegates in support of the ecclesiastical judges
and tribunals.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15490src" href="#xd21e15490"
name="xd21e15490src">14</a></p>
<p>The laws cited above did not become effective suddenly, but were
evolved through a long period of dissension and dispute between the
ecclesiastical and the civil authorities. Before the audiencia was
established in the Islands, the parish priests, friars, and
ecclesiastical ordinaries in many cases exercised the duties of local
judges in both the spiritual and temporal spheres. There can be no
question but that the church rendered very efficient service in this
particular, especially under the leadership of Bishop Salazar.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e15498src" href="#xd21e15498" name=
"xd21e15498src">15</a></p>
<p>The surrender of their prerogatives by the ecclesiastics was
gradually though reluctantly made as the civil courts became more
firmly established in the Islands. At first, the entire clergy, with
few exceptions, from the bishop to the most isolated parish priest,
opposed the change, and regarded the assumption of their former powers
by the civil authorities as unauthorized usurpation.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e15509src" href="#xd21e15509" name="xd21e15509src">16</a> It
was with great difficulty that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417"
href="#pb417" name="pb417">417</a>]</span>the churchmen were able to
adjust themselves to the new conditions. They were required frequently
to aid the civil authorities in the apprehension of criminals and in
the obtaining of testimony, thus co-operating generally in the
administration of justice.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15516src" href=
"#xd21e15516" name="xd21e15516src">17</a> A noteworthy conflict arose
when the audiencia summoned Bishop Salazar before it to testify as an
ordinary witness, and to explain his own actions on various occasions,
in retarding the work of the civil courts. These summonses he regarded
as detracting from his ecclesiastical immunity. Subsequently, the
audiencia was admonished that on no occasion should churchmen be called
to act as witnesses.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15521src" href=
"#xd21e15521" name="xd21e15521src">18</a> So it came about that
although the intervention of the audiencia was prescribed by the laws
of the Indies and admitted elsewhere in the Philippines, owing to the
strength of the ecclesiastical organization, and its former prominence
in affairs of government, the assumption of its legal power by the
audiencia was necessarily gradual. Nevertheless, the tribunal
ultimately attained extensive authority in ecclesiastical affairs, an
analysis of which will now be made. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb418" href="#pb418" name="pb418">418</a>]</span></p>
<p>The audiencia exercised jurisdiction as a high court of appeal over
suits to which the religious orders were parties. Most of these cases
originated in misunderstandings or contentions over jurisdiction,
titles to land, and over the claims relating to occupation of provinces
under the royal patronage, which the various orders advanced. Most
frequent of all were the suits between the orders, as to jurisdiction
over provinces. An example of this is furnished by the contention which
arose in 1736 between the Jesuits and the Recollects for the exclusive
right to minister in Mindanao. Another case of a similar nature was the
adjudication of a dispute between the Recollects and the Dominicans for
spiritual jurisdiction in the province of Zambales, as a result of
which the Recollects were finally ordered to confine their missionary
activities to Mindoro.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15533src" href=
"#xd21e15533" name="xd21e15533src">19</a> Another case was the dispute
between the Franciscans and the Observant friars. A large number of the
latter arrived in the Islands in 1648 with letters from the Viceroy of
New Spain. They were at once given territory which had been previously
assigned to the Franciscans. On the basis of a brief of Urban VIII,
prohibiting the occupation of the same province by two different
orders, the Franciscans brought suit in the audiencia with the result
that the newcomers were not only dispossessed of the province that had
been assigned to them, but their patents and briefs were cancelled on
the grounds that they were not properly authorized by the Council of
the Indies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15536src" href="#xd21e15536"
name="xd21e15536src">20</a></p>
<p>Reference was made in the last chapter to the suits which occurred
between the Jesuits and Dominicans, the two orders most extensively
interested in higher education, for the right to maintain universities
in Manila. The greater number of these disputes, in fact all of them,
seem to have been based on the rivalry of their two colleges and on
their zeal for royal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419"
name="pb419">419</a>]</span>favor and patronage. When Santo
Tom&aacute;s became a royal university in 1648, and was empowered to
grant degrees as such, the Jesuits brought suit in the audiencia for
the right to confer honors of a like character in their college of San
Jos&eacute;. The audiencia denied their petition; the case was appealed
to the Council of the Indies, and the higher authority decided that
both institutions should enjoy equally the privilege of conferring
scholastic honors.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15546src" href=
"#xd21e15546" name="xd21e15546src">21</a> The rivalry and bitter
feeling between these two orders did not cease with this settlement,
but in 1683 the Dominicans again brought suit in the audiencia, seeking
to limit the educational activities of the Jesuits. The matter was
again carried to the Council of the Indies. Although the decision was
made in favor of the Jesuits, the disagreements between the two orders,
the charges and counter-charges, and the influence of Archbishop Pardo,
a Dominican, in behalf of his own order, went far beyond the authority
of the audiencia, whose efforts to restrain them were entirely
ineffectual.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15549src" href="#xd21e15549"
name="xd21e15549src">22</a></p>
<p>Even the natives themselves, at times, went so far as to sue the
religious orders in the audiencia. This was done in 1738 when the
<i lang="es">mestizos</i> of Santa Cruz brought suit against the
Jesuits, because the latter had sought to make the residents of Santa
Cruz pay for certain improvements in the parishes of that district.
These improvements had been authorized by the Jesuits, and from them
the society had derived great benefit, while the residents had derived
no particular good from them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15557src"
href="#xd21e15557" name="xd21e15557src">23</a> In 1737, on complaint of
the natives, an investigation was conducted by Oidor Calder&oacute;n
which put a check upon certain transactions of the Jesuits in the
province of Batangas. It was proved that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb420" href="#pb420" name="pb420">420</a>]</span>they had collected
rents repeatedly from the Indians for lands to which they had no
title.</p>
<p>The most significant and decisive judicial authority which the
audiencia exercised in ecclesiastical matters, and that which was
productive of more conflicts and opposition on the part of the church
than any other cause, was the jurisdiction of the tribunal over the
secular church courts, at the head of which was the metropolitan
tribunal of the archbishop. The method of intervention most frequently
followed in cases appealed from the archbishop was by the entertainment
of the <i lang="es">recurso de fuerza</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15570src" href="#xd21e15570" name="xd21e15570src">24</a> In this
way the civil jurisdiction, acting through the audiencia, could
intervene for its own protection, and by means of this special
procedure that tribunal actually did restrain the ecclesiastical judges
more frequently and effectively in important cases than in any other
way. It was on the grounds of <i lang="es">fuerza</i> that the
audiencia justified its action in practically all cases of interference
with the jurisdiction of the church courts.</p>
<p>Cases of <i lang="es">fuerza</i> were those which came to the
audiencia through the abuse of their judicial powers by prelates or
ecclesiastical judges; cases, literally, in which the latter had
usurped or trespassed the authority of the civil courts or
government.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15581src" href="#xd21e15581"
name="xd21e15581src">25</a> The execution of the decision of an
ecclesiastical judge could be suspended by an edict of the audiencia on
the grounds of <i lang="es">fuerza</i>, while the case was being
investigated by that tribunal.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15590src"
href="#xd21e15590" name="xd21e15590src">26</a> The civil government
usually took the initiative in these appeals, but there were occasions
in the history of the Islands in which ecclesiastical authorities and
tribunals interposed <i lang="es">recursos de fuerza</i> against the
archbishop. In dealing with these cases the audiencia first ascertained
whether <i lang="es">fuerza</i> had been committed and then, if the
results <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href="#pb421" name=
"pb421">421</a>]</span>of the investigation were affirmative, the
tribunal was empowered to raise the <i lang="es">fuerza</i> (<i lang=
"es">alzar</i> or <i lang="es">quitar la fuerza</i>)<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e15613src" href="#xd21e15613" name="xd21e15613src">27</a> and
place limitations upon the ecclesiastical authority in order to prevent
future abuse of power.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15625src" href=
"#xd21e15625" name="xd21e15625src">28</a> The audiencia was without
authority to fine prelates, bishops, or ecclesiastical judges, but it
had sufficient jurisdiction to remedy excesses and restore conditions
to their former state. The tribunal was urged to use the utmost
discretion in dispossessing offending prelates and judges of their
benefices or positions,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15630src" href=
"#xd21e15630" name="xd21e15630src">29</a> as a punishment for <i lang=
"es">fuerza</i>, and not to proceed to such lengths except in
exceptional cases, wherein the strictest measures were necessary. On
such occasions the audiencia might exile the offending ecclesiastic,
giving account of its act to the Council of the Indies.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e15638src" href="#xd21e15638" name=
"xd21e15638src">30</a> All proceedings of this nature had to be carried
on secretly and with the greatest possible dispatch and
brevity,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15643src" href="#xd21e15643" name=
"xd21e15643src">31</a> and all churchmen who were deprived of their
benefices through the <i lang="es">recurso de fuerza</i> had the
privilege of an appeal to the Council of the Indies.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e15652src" href="#xd21e15652" name="xd21e15652src">32</a></p>
<p>In the treatment of cases of <i lang="es">fuerza</i> an informal
judicial hearing was given; the spirit of the proceeding was supposed
to be that of a harmonious investigation, in which both sides,
ecclesiastical and civil, were mutually and equally concerned in the
solution of a given problem, and in ascertaining wherein error had been
committed. The object of this proceeding was said to be the furtherance
of the interests of the crown, the salvation of souls and the spread of
the benevolent influence of the church. That the spirit of peace and
harmony failed to manifest itself at many of these investigations, is
shown by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href="#pb422" name=
"pb422">422</a>]</span>bitter contests which arose between the civil
and ecclesiastical judges as results of the entertainment of the
<i lang="es">recurso de fuerza</i>. The spiritual authorities alleged
on these occasions that they regarded the restraining action of the
government as presumption, unauthorized by ecclesiastical canons.</p>
<p>In the well-known Pardo controversy (1683&ndash;1689), references to
which may be found in any history of the Philippines, there occurred
many occasions on which the audiencia was obliged to avail itself of
the <i lang="es">recurso de fuerza</i>. By this means the audiencia
sought to restrain Archbishop Pardo from usurping the civil
jurisdiction and that of the religious orders and of the metropolitan
chapter. Interference with these orders was in violation of the royal
patronage, the ultimate authority over them being the patron and not
the archbishop. Such action, therefore, became a civil offense,
punishable by the civil tribunals, the highest of which and the one
properly equipped to deal with such cases, was the audiencia. It will
be noted that Pardo paid the penalty of exile for repeatedly ignoring
the audiencia and its right of interposition through the <i lang=
"es">recurso de fuerza</i>, and the subsequent ineffectiveness of the
audiencia was due to reasons and conditions other than the decline of
the authority and importance of the <i lang="es">recurso de fuerza</i>.
This controversy which is more fully described in preceding chapters
affords the best example extant of the operation of the <i lang=
"es">recurso de fuerza</i>, its nature and effects, hence the citation
of minor cases is rendered unnecessary.</p>
<p>Closely related to the question of <i lang="es">fuerza</i> as
illustrating the jurisdiction of the audiencia over the church courts,
occurs that of the interdict. A price which the civil authorities
frequently had to pay for the entertainment of the <i lang="es">recurso
de fuerza</i>, or any other opposition, in fact, to the unrestricted
authority of the ecclesiastics, was the penalty which usually
accompanied the interdict, of being forbidden to participate in
religious rites and ceremonies, or to continue receiving the customary
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name=
"pb423">423</a>]</span>spiritual consolations and benefits of the
church.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15691src" href="#xd21e15691" name=
"xd21e15691src">33</a> The authority of the audiencia to restrain the
excessive use of this weapon by the ecclesiastics may be considered to
have been judicial in its nature, since the prelates, by undue use of
the episcopal censure, went beyond their ecclesiastical jurisdiction
and encroached upon the royal prerogative. A form of judicial inquiry
was instituted to ascertain the act and degree of encroachment; indeed,
the excessive use of the interdict was interpreted to constitute
<i lang="es">fuerza</i>, and the method just described was employed by
the tribunal to combat it.</p>
<p>We may turn again to the Pardo <span class="corr" id="xd21e15702"
title="Source: controvery">controversy</span> for an example of the
intervention of the audiencia to restrain a prelate from excessive use
of the interdict. Pardo, after his return from exile, fulminated
censures against ex-Governor Juan de Vargas and the entire audiencia
which had supported him against the archbishop. The ban against the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> was quickly removed, technically on the
grounds that the magistrates were still royal officials, but in reality
for the sake of expediency. Vargas, however, was not absolved. The
audiencia, according to the existing laws, had the right to force the
prelate to remove the ban,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15708src" href=
"#xd21e15708" name="xd21e15708src">34</a> but owing to dissensions
within the tribunal, the opposition of the new governor, the increasing
power of the archbishop, the certainty that the royal authority had
already disapproved of its acts, and the impending visitation of a
royal commissioner (Valdivia), who had instructions to settle the
discord and strife at Manila at any cost, the <i lang="es">oidores</i>
thought it best not to take this step. The archbishop refused to
absolve Vargas because of the technical reason that his case came under
the jurisdiction of the Inquisition.</p>
<p>The audiencia was expected to restrain the interdict whenever this
ecclesiastical prohibition interfered with the government <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb424" href="#pb424" name="pb424">424</a>]</span>or
incapacitated the officials thereof from executing their duties. The
interdict was not to interfere with the royal prerogative, nor was it
to be imposed for insignificant causes or personal reasons.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e15724src" href="#xd21e15724" name=
"xd21e15724src">35</a> The audiencia was given the special injunction
not to interfere with censures generally, but to permit them to be
applied in needful cases, the <i lang="es">oidores</i> bearing in mind
only the requirement that these ecclesiastical measures should not be
allowed to interfere with the civil government.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15732src" href="#xd21e15732" name="xd21e15732src">36</a></p>
<p>It had frequently been the practice of the prelates to pronounce
censures against <i lang="es">oidores</i> and <i lang=
"es">alcaldes</i>, who, in proceeding with their duties as inspectors
of the provinces, encroached upon what the churchmen regarded as their
own particular and private <span class="corr" id="xd21e15745" title=
"Source: jurisdicton">jurisdiction</span>. This, of course, was
forbidden, and the audiencia, by way of <i lang="es">fuerza</i>,
usually entertained appeals from these officials of the civil
government and set aside all such acts on the part of the
representatives of the church. Reference was made in the last chapter
to the circumstances surrounding the effort of Oidor Guerela to inspect
the province of Camarines. This magistrate was excommunicated by the
bishop of that diocese and was compelled to remain in banishment five
months, the audiencia refusing to set aside the censure on account of
the personal animosity of the magistrates toward Guerela. Nevertheless,
prelates were enjoined to obey the audiencia when that tribunal ordered
the cancellation or suspension of an episcopal censure or
prohibition.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15751src" href="#xd21e15751"
name="xd21e15751src">37</a> When an appeal was made to the audiencia
from such an act by an <i lang="es">alcalde</i>, <i lang=
"es">oidor</i>, visitor, or other official at some distance from the
capital, the prelate was expected, upon the judicial summons of the
audiencia, to suspend his censure until the facts of the case had been
ascertained, and the decision of the tribunal had been
rendered.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15763src" href="#xd21e15763" name=
"xd21e15763src">38</a> This was the law, but occasionally, as in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href="#pb425" name=
"pb425">425</a>]</span>the case of Guerela, local circumstances
rendered impossible or undesirable the fulfillment of the law.</p>
<p>It has been shown in the preceding chapter that before the coming of
the audiencia, the church had utilized the weapon of excommunication on
very slight pretext, and it had been partly for the purpose of
restraining this abuse that the audiencia was established.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e15772src" href="#xd21e15772" name=
"xd21e15772src">39</a> The early governors, especially, had many
difficulties with this phase of ecclesiastical high-handedness and the
letters of such executives as De Vera, Tello, Dasmari&ntilde;as, and
Morga complained continually against this particular abuse of power by
the prelates,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15775src" href="#xd21e15775"
name="xd21e15775src">40</a> regretting the lack of any authority to set
aside these excessive acts on the part of the churchmen. All the
above-mentioned governors had been excommunicated for various acts in
opposition to the ecclesiastical power. Governor Ronquillo, in the
characteristic letter which is quoted in another part of this treatise,
reported that the audiencia, after its establishment, had effectively
restrained the excesses of excommunication on the part of the
church.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15778src" href="#xd21e15778" name=
"xd21e15778src">41</a> Indeed, during the twenty-five years succeeding
Ronquillo&rsquo;s term as governor, the audiencia had so frequently set
aside ecclesiastical censures, and so completely terminated the abuses
of the privilege of sanctuary by friars and priests, in fact so
generally held at naught the principle of ecclesiastical immunity, that
the king, on November 13, 1626, was obliged to issue a special <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> in restraint of his Manila tribunal and for the
protection of the ecclesiastical jurisdictions.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15784src" href="#xd21e15784" name="xd21e15784src">42</a></p>
<p>Examination of a large number of cases shows that the method by
which the audiencia set aside excommunication was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href="#pb426" name=
"pb426">426</a>]</span>usually through an ultimate reliance on force.
Nevertheless, taking three hundred years of the history of the
Philippines into consideration, there were relatively few cases in
which matters went so far that the audiencia actually had to use force,
the case being usually that the judicial protest of the tribunal
against an abuse of this kind was sufficient. Theoretically, any act of
excommunication or interdict was suspended, <i lang="la">ipso
facto</i>, by the intervention of the audiencia pending further
investigation, and the prelate was required to abide by the decision of
the tribunal.</p>
<p>The following typical cases may be cited to show that the audiencia
frequently did rely on the civil power, as a last resort, for the
enforcement of its injunctions. In 1623, an <i lang="es">oidor</i> was
excommunicated for having violated the ecclesiastical sanctuary in
seizing Juan Soto de Vega, a fugitive from justice, who had taken
refuge in the cathedral. The audiencia, finding itself opposed by the
metropolitan court, sent a constable to arrest the <i lang=
"es">provisor</i> who had fulminated the excommunication, threatening
the latter with a fine of two thousand pesos and banishment if he did
not desist and cancel the censure. The archbishop, who at first
supported the <i lang="es">provisor</i>, was put under military guard
at the behest of the audiencia. The Jesuits then used their good
offices in behalf of the government, as a result of which the matter
was arbitrated and peace was brought about.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15813src" href="#xd21e15813" name="xd21e15813src">43</a> In 1636,
however, the archbishop and <i lang="es">provisor</i> were banished and
fined heavily, because they persisted in a censure which the audiencia
had restrained. Their continual refusal to harken to the commands of
the vicepatron and the royal tribunal and their insistence on the
censure were adjudged to constitute <i lang="es">fuerza</i>. This case
originated in the violation of the right of asylum by the governor and
the arrest of a murderer who had taken refuge in the Augustinian
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href="#pb427" name=
"pb427">427</a>]</span>convent. So open was the defiance of the civil
government that the criminal was executed in the courtyard, under the
very windows of the convent wherein were congregated the prelate and
his supporters who were commanded not to touch the body for three
days.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15825src" href="#xd21e15825" name=
"xd21e15825src">44</a> The archbishop was removed from his convent by
soldiers at the command of the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> and banished to
the island of Corregidor, where he remained twenty-six days, after
which mediation was effected and the weak old prelate, tottering with
age, was restored to his metropolitan capital.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15834src" href="#xd21e15834" name="xd21e15834src">45</a> Montero
y Vidal states that this case is interesting and important as a test of
the power of the governor; for many persons, he alleges, did not
believe that the governor could raise an interdict.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e15840src" href="#xd21e15840" name="xd21e15840src">46</a> That
he was enabled to do so, with the support of the audiencia and with the
aid of his military forces there can be no question.</p>
<p>Some reference should be made at this time to the abuses of the
interdict by Archbishop Pardo. This prelate went so far as to place a
ban upon the church of the Jesuits because it contained the dead body
of an offending <i lang="es">oidor</i>. For reasons other than the lack
of legal authority, the audiencia was powerless to restrain his
censures at that time. On another occasion the audiencia and governor,
by placing armed guards at the doors of the Dominican church and
preventing the celebration of services therein, suppressed an interdict
which had been issued through the influence of that order on behalf of
Archbishop Pardo. Governor Bustamante claimed that he was acting in
accordance with his own properly constituted authority in 1719, when he
appointed his own audiencia, set aside repeated interdicts, penetrated
the asylum of the church, arrested the archbishop and defied the entire
ecclesiastical organization. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb428" href=
"#pb428" name="pb428">428</a>]</span>He seems to have exceeded his
powers no more flagrantly than did some of his predecessors under like
circumstances; yet, for personal and political reasons, he was unable
to count on the support of the other elements of the colony in this
struggle with the ecclesiastical power and the battle ended
disastrously for him. Acting-Governor Anda, relying on armed force
alone, defended Manila against the British, achieved victory for his
cause and secured the approbation of the king in the face of repeated
ecclesiastical censures from Archbishop Rojo. These incidents, which
occupy a prominent place in the history of the Philippines, illustrate
the usual method by which ecclesiastical censures were set aside in
actual practice, either by the audiencia or by the vicepatron, who was
supported by the tribunal.</p>
<p>A department of the church over which the audiencia did not have
such complete authority, either judicially or administratively, was the
Inquisition. Properly speaking, there was no tribunal of the Holy
Office in the Philippines, the Inquisition being represented in Manila
by a commissary.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15855src" href=
"#xd21e15855" name="xd21e15855src">47</a> This representative was
sufficiently powerful, however, to constitute a worthy opponent for the
civil power and one who, on account <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb429" href="#pb429" name="pb429">429</a>]</span>of the immunities
which he enjoyed and because of the secret methods which he was able to
employ, kept all the tribunals and authorities of the civil government
at a respectful distance.</p>
<p>Although the laws of the Indies directed that the inquisitors who
were sent to the colonies should present their titles to the audiencias
and viceroys, this did not give the civil authorities any advantage
over them. The audiencia was expected to formally receive the
inquisitors and to pay them all due respect.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15865src" href="#xd21e15865" name="xd21e15865src">48</a> At the
time of the establishment of the Inquisition in Manila, no audiencia as
yet existed. From the very beginning, however, the dignitaries of the
Inquisition were placed under special royal protection, with complete
power over their own sphere. Officials of the government and all other
persons were warned and enjoined not to interfere with or oppose them
in any way. As early as May 22, 1610, the Council of the Indies placed
itself and all subordinate audiencias and governors in a position
inferior to that of the Inquisition. The interference of civil
magistrates with the inquisitors in behalf of the government was
forbidden,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15870src" href="#xd21e15870"
name="xd21e15870src">49</a> even the ordinary means of protection were
denied them. The <i lang="es">recurso de fuerza</i> could not be
employed, nor could the interdicts of the inquisitors be raised, even
in notorious cases of their infringement upon the royal
jurisdiction.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15879src" href="#xd21e15879"
name="xd21e15879src">50</a> Little change was made in these laws until
the latter part of the eighteenth century. The <i lang="es">oidores</i>
were ordered to lend such secular aid as might be required, and were
originally instructed to obey the mandates and carry out the orders of
the inquisitors without inquiries into the religious reason for any
action the latter might take. Each judge, ecclesiastical or royal, was
to limit himself strictly to his own <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb430" href="#pb430" name="pb430">430</a>]</span>particular field and
thus conflicts of authority were to be avoided.</p>
<p>The laws of the Indies prescribed many regulations which were
designed to induce harmony and co-operation between the officials of
the Inquisition and those of the civil government. Viceroys, audiencias
and governors were authorized to execute the sentences of the
representatives of the Inquisition and to extend to them every facility
and assistance.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15896src" href="#xd21e15896"
name="xd21e15896src">51</a> <i lang="es">Oidores</i> and executives
were forbidden to open the mail or tamper with the correspondence or
legal documents of the inquisitors.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15904src" href="#xd21e15904" name="xd21e15904src">52</a> <i lang=
"es">Oidores</i> and <i lang="es">fiscales</i> were authorized to give
legal advice to the judges of the Inquisition when counsel of this kind
was required.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15916src" href="#xd21e15916"
name="xd21e15916src">53</a> The inquisitors were to be given precedence
over the officials of the civil government in everything pertaining to
the official duties of the former, but in questions of civil
administration and in matters of ceremony, the <i lang="es">oidores</i>
took precedence over inquisitors, unless the latter enjoyed higher rank
by virtue of some other office.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15924src"
href="#xd21e15924" name="xd21e15924src">54</a></p>
<p>The tendency of the laws, however, through a period of two hundred
years, was to delimit and circumscribe the authority of the Inquisition
in matters bordering on the jurisdiction of the civil government. This
is seen, especially, in the offense of polygamy, which, up to 1754, was
dealt with solely by the Inquisition. By the <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> of March 19th of that year, polygamy was brought
under the <i lang="es">fuero mixto</i>;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15937src" href="#xd21e15937" name="xd21e15937src">55</a> the same
law ordered that prisoners, after punishment by the inquisitorial
tribunal for heresy, should be dealt with by civil judges for an
offense against the laws of the realm. On September 7, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href="#pb431" name=
"pb431">431</a>]</span>1766, this crime was again made punishable
solely by the Inquisition, but on August 10, 1788, jurisdiction over
cases of polygamy was taken entirely from the Inquisition and given to
the royal justices.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15948src" href=
"#xd21e15948" name="xd21e15948src">56</a> This may be considered as
indicative of the decline of the authority of the Inquisition in the
eighteenth century. The inquisitors, of course, were not permitted to
exercise jurisdiction over the Chinese, or over the aboriginal
inhabitants of the Islands.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15955src" href=
"#xd21e15955" name="xd21e15955src">57</a></p>
<p>In its relations with the civil power in the Philippines, and
particularly with the audiencia, two charges have been brought against
the Inquisition. The first was that in the early years of the
Islands&rsquo; history, it was utilized by the prelates for the more
complete usurpation of powers belonging to the civil government and the
audiencia. The tribunal, of course, was left entirely without recourse,
by virtue of the exemptions and immunities of the Inquisition mentioned
above. On July 20, 1585, the audiencia, in a letter to the king, cited
several instances in which Bishop Salazar, unwilling to cede his claims
to jurisdiction over certain civil offenders, handed them over to the
commissary of the Inquisition, instead of surrendering them to the
audiencia, to which jurisdiction over such cases belonged. The
audiencia, appealing to the king for aid, alleged that the prelate had
taken undue advantage of the civil power, &ldquo;by sheltering himself
behind the Inquisition, ... where the audiencia has no
jurisdiction.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15963src" href=
"#xd21e15963" name="xd21e15963src">58</a> This charge <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb432" href="#pb432" name="pb432">432</a>]</span>was
also brought against Salazar by the Jesuit, S&aacute;nchez, in his
memorial of 1591.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15976src" href=
"#xd21e15976" name="xd21e15976src">59</a> It is significant that no
decree was issued during the earlier era which authorized the audiencia
to repair the abuses of the inquisitors, although on many occasions the
audiencia and the local court of the Inquisition were respectively
enjoined to confine themselves to their own particular fields of
authority.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15979src" href="#xd21e15979"
name="xd21e15979src">60</a></p>
<p>The second charge made against the Inquisition was that it allowed
itself to be influenced, utilized, and possessed by individuals and
private interests for their own selfish ends. Under these conditions
the audiencia was powerless; the Inquisition openly fought the
government and vanquished it entirely on various notable occasions.
There may be found no better illustration of this than the Salcedo
affair in 1667 and 1668, during which the commissary of the Inquisition
was the instrument of the governor&rsquo;s enemies, proceeding to such
excesses in his zeal that he ultimately proved to be the agent of his
own downfall.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15985src" href="#xd21e15985"
name="xd21e15985src">61</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb433" href=
"#pb433" name="pb433">433</a>]</span></p>
<p>The various sacerdotal historians of the Philippines, in treating of
the Salcedo affair, agree that the failure of the audiencia to do its
duty in checking the so-called excesses of the governor led the prelate
and the ecclesiastical dignitaries of the colony to turn to the
Inquisition for relief.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15999src" href=
"#xd21e15999" name="xd21e15999src">62</a> Among the acts of treason
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href="#pb434" name=
"pb434">434</a>]</span>and heresy of which Governor Salcedo was said to
have been guilty, the most conspicuous were his negotiations with the
Dutch at Batavia for the conquest by them of the city of
Manila.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16029src" href="#xd21e16029" name=
"xd21e16029src">63</a> This was the leading pretext for his arrest. We
have already mentioned in a former chapter that the conduct of the
<i lang="es">oidores</i> was not above reproach on this occasion.
Immediately after the removal of the governor, a dispute arose between
magistrates Coloma and Montemayor for the control of affairs, only to
be settled by the usurpation of the government by the ecclesiastical
candidate, B&oacute;nifaz. With Salcedo out of the way and the
audiencia intimidated and powerless, the Inquisition and the
ecclesiastics ruled with a high hand for a period of three years, until
the arrival of the new governor, Manuel de Le&oacute;n, in
1671.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16053src" href="#xd21e16053" name=
"xd21e16053src">64</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href=
"#pb435" name="pb435">435</a>]</span></p>
<p>The audiencia, after it had been reconstructed by Governor
Le&oacute;n, gave some account to the king of the excesses of
&ldquo;Fray Joseph de Paternina, religious of the order of San
Agust&iacute;n, and commissary of the Holy Inquisition, who has been so
vain and haughty since the imprisonment of Governor Salcedo, a thing
very unfortunate for these Islands.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16066src" href="#xd21e16066" name="xd21e16066src">65</a> The most
harmful result of the affair, in the estimation of the audiencia, was
the growing feeling on the part of the people of the Philippines
&ldquo;that the Inquisition (was) the most powerful agency there, and
that every person in the colony was subject to it.&rdquo; The
effrontery of the commissary was said to have gone so far on one
occasion that he entered the <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> session of the
audiencia and violently interfered with its proceedings, forcibly
arresting and carrying away persons attendant thereupon. This defiant
and insolent act was the greatest offense that could be offered to the
royal authority, and the audiencia felt that if a continuance of these
excesses were tolerated the royal tribunal would be despised and held
at naught by the very citizens who should regard it with the most
veneration.</p>
<p>A list of the acts of aggression on the part of the commissary was
submitted by the audiencia at this time. He had commuted a sentence
pronounced by the tribunal and had excused various fines imposed by the
tribunal, declaring publicly that it was not necessary to obey the acts
of this body of lawyers. He had excommunicated all the magistrates of
the audiencia, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb436" href="#pb436" name=
"pb436">436</a>]</span>who remained for a long period without recourse
and without the privileges of religious communion. He had interfered on
behalf of an <i lang="es">encomendero</i> who was on trial before the
audiencia. He had produced such a state of affairs that the impotence
of the civil government was a subject of common jest, even in the
mouths of the natives. The supporters of the government had been
reduced to a panic of fear, not knowing where the wrath of the
Inquisition would fall next. The commissary, on the other hand, had
fortified himself with claims of immunity and had acted in defiance of
royal and ecclesiastical law by erecting a tribunal of which he was the
head, notwithstanding the fact that such an institution was forbidden
in the Philippines. The audiencia presented this picture of affairs in
its memorial, admitting its incapacity to cope with this powerful
institution, whose acts were prepared and executed in secrecy. The evil
situation for which he was responsible could only be repaired by an
appeal to Mexico. Meanwhile the government and people in the
Philippines were compelled to suffer the consequences of his assumption
of authority.</p>
<p>There was no tribunal or any other agency in the Philippines able to
place an effective check on the triumphant inquisitor. The only relief
that could come was furnished on June 4, 1671, in the appointment of a
new commissary, who was ordered to arrest Paternina and send him back
to New Spain. This timely relief emanated from the tribunal of the
Inquisition of Mexico, which by this act manifested its disapproval of
all that had been done by its ambitious agent. On August 12, 1672, the
Council of the Indies also disapproved of Paternina&rsquo;s acts in
connection with the establishment of a Philippine tribunal.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e16081src" href="#xd21e16081" name=
"xd21e16081src">66</a> The new commissary did nothing toward the
continuance of the tribunal which his predecessor had established
illegally. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437" name=
"pb437">437</a>]</span></p>
<p>With these manifestations of the royal support, the audiencia, which
had been reconstituted on the arrival of Governor Le&oacute;n, regained
its authority and proceeded ably to second the executive in his
struggle with the powerful ecclesiastical organization. The new
commissary, who had lost his papers in a shipwreck, appealed to the
tribunal for recognition and support in a struggle which he had
undertaken against the Franciscans. Through the aid given him by the
audiencia, he imprisoned the provincial and definitor of that order.
Then the audiencia reconsidered its decision and effected the
liberation of the two prisoners on the ground that the title of the
commissary did not authorize him to act at this time.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e16089src" href="#xd21e16089" name="xd21e16089src">67</a> In
interfering with and actually cancelling the acts of the commissary,
the audiencia was exceeding its authority, for the laws prescribed that
his decisions could be reversed only by his immediate superior, the
tribunal of Mexico. However, the audiencia maintained that it was
acting in accordance with the law which authorized it to receive and
recognize inquisitors. On this occasion it was merely deciding that the
commissary was acting without proper authority since his credentials
had never arrived.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16092src" href=
"#xd21e16092" name="xd21e16092src">68</a> At this time, the moral
standing of the Philippine agent of the Inquisition was at a very low
ebb, both in Manila and Madrid, which, of course, influenced the
decision of the audiencia.</p>
<p>The Salcedo affair and the succeeding events make it clear that
neither the authority of the audiencia nor of the Inquisition was
unlimited. The fear and respect with which the latter institution was
regarded contributed to its momentary triumph. The audiencia did not
interfere with or seek to restrain the acts of the commissary; indeed,
the tribunal connived at the exile of the vicepatron since the <i lang=
"es">oidores</i> expected to profit from the act. During these three
years the Inquisition allied itself <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb438" href="#pb438" name="pb438">438</a>]</span>practically to every
interest in the colony which had been opposed to the governor. The
royal interests were for a time forgotten and wholly unchampioned,
owing to the weakness of the audiencia, the removal of the governor,
and the united front presented by the ecclesiastical element. This
condition was altered by the arrival of a new governor who bore
evidence of the disapprobation of the superior government. The tribunal
of Mexico discountenanced the acts of its former representative, and
that disapproval was further emphasized by the adverse attitude of the
Council of the Indies. The audiencia was restored to its proper
position, and, in conjunction with the vicepatron, it resumed its
status as the agent of the royal will. So it may be asserted that the
supremacy of both authorities was relative, recognition depending
partially on local circumstances and ultimately on the attitude of the
superior government. In fact, it may be said that the latter was the
deciding factor. In the struggle itself, before the decision of the
home authorities was rendered, the preponderance of power was enjoyed
by the Inquisition. This was owing to the advantages which law and
precedent had given to it as a privileged ecclesiastical tribunal,
although the efficacy of the Inquisition lay for the most part in the
immunities which were extended to it and in its swift, unexpected and
secret methods. Its ultimate defeat on this occasion, and the continued
abuse of its power, did much to detract from its prestige and authority
in the Philippines.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16104src" href=
"#xd21e16104" name="xd21e16104src">69</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb439" href="#pb439" name="pb439">439</a>]</span></p>
<p>During the eighteenth century considerable authority over the
Inquisition was given to the civil courts. The former position of
supremacy, wherein its authority could not be so much as questioned by
a secular tribunal, was gone forever. On August 2, 1748, a decree was
promulgated whereby chanceries, audiencias, and <i lang=
"es">corregidores</i> were authorized to restrain any inquisitorial
tribunal from maltreating its own prisoners.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16113src" href="#xd21e16113" name="xd21e16113src">70</a> This
same law provided for the punishment by the civil courts of inquisitors
who contravened this law. This was the first regulation which really
gave to the audiencia the power necessary to restrain the acts of the
Inquisition. We find no indication of any such liberal legislation in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but by the time this law was
promulgated, the power of the church in Spain was considerably reduced
and that of the Inquisition was already on the decline. By a number of
subsequent laws the Inquisition was gradually but surely limited in
power and authority. We have already noted that on August 10, 1788,
jurisdiction over the crime of polygamy and over cases involving the
infraction of the marriage relation was taken from the Inquisition and
given to the civil courts.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16121src" href=
"#xd21e16121" name="xd21e16121src">71</a> By the <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> of December 12, 1807, authority was given to the
royal justices to receive inquisitors, inspect their titles and to
assign them to their districts, assisting them in all possible ways.
The civil authorities were ordered to guard against an excessive number
of these functionaries. The magistrates were especially instructed to
act as guardians of the royal prerogative in dealing with the
representative of the Inquisition and to report to the superior
government on their relations with them. By this <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i> the authority of the inquisitorial agents was
distinctly limited to matters of faith, with appeal to the tribunal of
the Inquisition. The magistrates <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb440"
href="#pb440" name="pb440">440</a>]</span>were ordered to see that
these instructions were followed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16135src"
href="#xd21e16135" name="xd21e16135src">72</a> In this way the civil
authorities, and particularly the magistrates of the audiencias, became
the guardians of the royal prerogative against the agents of the
Inquisition, who were kept within the proper bounds of a purely
religious jurisdiction.</p>
<p>It would be desirable, did time and space allow it, to illustrate
further the jurisdiction of the audiencia over ecclesiastical affairs
by showing in detail the part which the tribunal played in the friar
lands litigation<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16154src" href=
"#xd21e16154" name="xd21e16154src">73</a> and in the disputes over
ecclesiastical visitation in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
in the Philippines. It will be sufficient here to state that the
government sought at irregular intervals and with varying <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb441" href="#pb441" name=
"pb441">441</a>]</span>degrees of success, to make the orders prove
titles to lands in the same manner that was required of other
corporations and individuals.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16162src"
href="#xd21e16162" name="xd21e16162src">74</a> The audiencia, as a
tribunal, and the individual magistrates as special commissioners,
participated judicially in the examination of these titles and in the
correction of the abuses which were discovered. The <i lang=
"es">oidores</i>, when serving as special magistrates for the
verification of these titles, officiated in a double capacity. By the
very nature of the services rendered they were judges. They were also
agents of the royal patron and as such they represented the person of
the king, ascertaining whether the royal rights had been usurped or
infringed upon.</p>
<p>Closely similar to the jurisdiction of the audiencia as a court of
final resort in the testing of the titles to lands occupied by
religious orders was that which it exercised in the matter of
ecclesiastical visitation. This was a question of a more thoroughly
religious character which did not concern the civil government as
intimately as did the matter of friar lands. In general, it may be said
that the audiencia was utilized by both sides in the various disputes
which arose in connection with ecclesiastical visitation. During the
ecclesiastical administrations of Archbishops Salazar, Serrano,
Poblete, Camacho, Pardo and Justa y Rufina, practically until the end
of the eighteenth century, this question was continually agitated.
These archbishops attempted to visit and inspect the curacies
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb442" href="#pb442" name=
"pb442">442</a>]</span>which were held by friars in lieu of secular
priests.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16193src" href="#xd21e16193" name=
"xd21e16193src">75</a> The archbishops relied on the audiencia for
assistance in the enforcement of their claims and the friars sought its
protection as a court of justice to shield them from the visitation of
the prelate. As in the matter of the friar lands, so in this question,
the audiencia acted both as a tribunal of justice and as an agent and
champion of the royal patronage. Indeed, the laws of the Indies
established the audiencia as a tribunal and as a compelling authority
for the enforcement of ecclesiastical visitation.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16199src" href="#xd21e16199" name="xd21e16199src">76</a> The
archbishop was directed to appeal to the audiencia or vicepatron for
assistance in the subjection of offending curates,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e16205src" href="#xd21e16205" name="xd21e16205src">77</a> but
he was forbidden to visit the regulars in their convents,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e16210src" href="#xd21e16210" name=
"xd21e16210src">78</a> which, of course, did not prevent his visiting
them when in charge of curacies. On the other hand, the audiencia was
forbidden to entertain appeals on the ground of <i lang="es">fuerza</i>
from regulars who objected to the visitation of the prelates.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e16219src" href="#xd21e16219" name=
"xd21e16219src">79</a></p>
<p>Local conditions in the Philippines did much toward determining the
character of the support rendered by the audiencia both to the
archbishops and to the friars. During the later months of the Pardo
controversy, when the audiencia had been demoralized by the triumph of
the archbishop and the visitor, Valdivia, the decision of the tribunal
had but little weight and the prelate did as he wished in regard to the
matter of visitation. In Camacho&rsquo;s time, when the friars were on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href="#pb443" name=
"pb443">443</a>]</span>the point of leaving the Islands rather than
submit to visitation, the audiencia and the governor wisely counseled
moderation and completely abandoned the obstinate prelate. During
Anda&rsquo;s term of office the question was again taken up, but the
effort to enforce the principle was abandoned because the government
could not find seculars, either Spanish or native, to take the place of
the friars who threatened to leave the Islands if visitation were
insisted upon. The magistrates likewise rendered invaluable service in
imparting legal advice to the vicepatron, friars and others interested.
They also kept the court informed as to what was actually transpiring
in the colony. It may be seen, therefore, that the audiencia
participated in two important ways in the enforcement of episcopal
visitation. It was primarily a court; it acted as agent of the royal
patron. In these capacities the influence of the tribunal was greatest.
It also exercised functions of an advisory character in aiding the
authorities concerned to ascertain their rights according to the
existing law.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16228src" href="#xd21e16228"
name="xd21e16228src">80</a></p>
<p>In summarizing the results of the investigation with which this
chapter has been concerned, it may be said that the audiencia
constituted a court of appeal in ecclesiastical cases wherein the
services of an impartial, non-ecclesiastical tribunal were required, or
wherein the defense of the royal jurisdiction against the aggression of
the churchmen was involved. In defending the civil government from
ecclesiastical usurpation the audiencia acted in defense of the royal
patronage. Nevertheless, in the cases noted, namely, in settling
disputes between orders, between the secular church and the orders,
between either of these and the civil government, in entertaining
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb444" href="#pb444" name=
"pb444">444</a>]</span><i lang="es">recursos de fuerza</i>, in
restraining the interdict, and the abuses of the Inquisition, the
audiencia acted by judicial process as a tribunal of justice, and not
in the capacity of an administrative committee or an executive agent,
as in the cases which have been heretofore described. <span class=

Note by A. P. Cushing, in Blair and Robertson, V, 292. Escriche
(<i lang="es">Diccionario</i>, I, 838&ndash;9) defines <i lang=
"es">fuerza</i> as &ldquo;the wrong which an ecclesiastical judge does
to a party when he assumes jurisdiction over a case which does not
belong to him, or when he fails to observe the rules prescribed by the
laws and canons, or when he unjustly denies appeal.&rdquo; <i lang=
"es">Recurso de fuerza</i> is defined as the reclamation to a civil
judge, made by a person believing himself aggrieved by an
ecclesiastical judge, imploring the protection of the former in order
that the <i lang="es">fuerza</i> or violence may be terminated or
undone. There are three ways mentioned by Alcubilla in which an
ecclesiastical judge may commit <i lang="es">fuerza</i>: 1. When he
assumes jurisdiction in a purely temporal case, which by its very
nature is not rightfully subject to his authority. 2. When, by trying a
case whose jurisdiction belongs to him, he fails to observe the method
and form prescribed by the laws and canons. 3. When he refuses to allow
appeals which should be rightfully allowed (Mart&iacute;nez Alcubilla,
<i lang="es">Diccionario</i>, V, 807).</p>

<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>, 2&ndash;15&ndash;148, 149. The
interdict, as defined by Escriche (<i lang="es">Diccionario</i>, I,
712), is a prohibition, mandate, or censure, pronounced by an
ecclesiastical authority by which is prohibited the use of certain
spiritual privileges which are common to all. The effect of the
interdict may be to prohibit Christian burial, the administration of
the sacraments or the celebration of divine services. Exception may be
made in rare cases of baptisms, confirmation and confession for the
dying. Even though the interdict may be pronounced it does not prohibit
the saying of mass in a low voice behind closed doors and without the
ringing of bells. A priest who violates the interdict may be pronounced
&ldquo;irregular&rdquo;, but a layman who does so may incur the penalty
of excommunication (see <i>Catholic Encyclopedia</i>, under
&ldquo;Interdict&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15343" href="#xd21e15343src" name="xd21e15343">5</a></span> This
refers to the privilege extended by the church to offenders against the
laws of the realm, who were allowed to take refuge from the civil
authorities in a church or convent. This practice was recognized by the
government. By a bull of Clement XIV, the right of extending asylum was
limited to a few churches only, the number of these depending on the
population of the town or city. Those guilty of certain specified
crimes of the most heinous character were denied the privilege of
sanctuary. The act of sheltering oneself under the protection of God
was supposed to be spontaneous and not premeditated. The privilege was
often abused by individual churchmen (Escriche, <i lang=
"es">Diccionario</i>, I, 353).</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15355" href="#xd21e15355src" name="xd21e15355">6</a></span> A
clarifying description of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction has been
given by Escriche. He defines it as &ldquo;the power of the Church for
the trial and adjudication of civil and criminal affairs exercised
either by its own right or by concession of princes.&rdquo; This
jurisdiction, says Escriche, is of two kinds, inherent (spiritual) and
privileged (temporal). After classifying the different cases which fall
naturally under each category, he describes the tribunals for the
interpretation of canon law. &ldquo;The ecclesiastical
jurisdiction,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;the inherent, as well as the
privileged, is exercised, in first instance, by the bishops and
archbishops in their respective dioceses, in the second, by the
metropolitan with respect to the suffragans, and in the third, by the
papal delegate. The bishops and archbishops do not exercise the
jurisdiction by themselves but by means of their <i lang=
"es">provisores</i> or <i lang="es">vicarios</i>. These latter may be
either <i lang="es">generales</i> or <i lang=
"es">for&aacute;neos</i>.... The term <i lang="es">provisor</i> or
vicar-general is used to designate him who exercises the ordinary
ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the entire territory of the diocese and
resides in the episcopal city situated therein; ... <i lang=
"es">for&aacute;neos</i> are the others established as delegates in
certain parts of the diocese in order to facilitate the administration
of justice; no appointments to these offices may be made without the
royal approbation. The authority of the <i lang="es">provisores</i> and
<i lang="es">vicarios</i> cease by death of the prelate from whom they
obtained the nomination, and is reassumed by the <i lang=
"es">cabildo</i> or chapter, <i lang="es">sede vacante</i>, which
selects persons to succeed them&rdquo; (Escriche, <i lang=
"es">Diccionario</i>, II, 453).</p>
<p class="footnote">Escriche further describes this hierarchy of
ecclesiastical judges: &ldquo;The metropolitans, then, are the ordinary
judges of first instance with regard to the archbishoprics and at the
same time they are the judges of appeal from the suffragans, and,
accordingly, they are accustomed to appoint, aside from the <i lang=
"es">provisores</i> or <i lang="es">vicarios</i>, <i lang=
"es">ordinarios</i> who discharge the functions of judges of first
instance. As the <i lang="es">obispos exentos</i> are not subject to a
metropolitan, but directly to the holy see, recourses of appeals from
their decisions go to the papal delegate.&rdquo; The cases of appeal
from the metropolitans and other ecclesiastical judges were heard in
third and last instance by the tribunal known as the <i lang=
"es">rota</i> of the papal delegate, which was composed of the <i lang=
"es">nuncio</i> of the pope, and the ecclesiastical auditors appointed
by the crown.</p>
<p class="footnote">The ecclesiastical courts of the Philippines
conformed generally, in organization and limits of jurisdiction, to the
scheme outlined in the preceding paragraphs. The three bishops of Nueva
Segovia, Camarines, and Ceb&uacute; had their courts in the chief towns
of their respective dioceses. They were assisted by the customary
<i lang="es">provisores</i>. Appeals were carried from them to the
court of the metropolitan which was located in Manila; this latter
tribunal consisted of the archbishop, the vicar-general, and a notary.
Above this court was that of the papal delegate who tried cases of
appeal from the lower tribunal in accordance with canon law. In
conformity with a bull of Gregory XIII, dated May 15, 1572, the
authority of the papal delegate in appeal cases was final; &ldquo;he
might overrule and even supersede the metropolitan, as being the judge
in final appeal.&rdquo; The Bishop of Camarines most frequently acted
as papal delegate (Blair and Robertson, XLII, 27, Note 4). Aside from
these courts there was that of the commissary of the Inquisition whose
jurisdiction will be subsequently noted.</p>
<p class="footnote">Each order, also, had its own judicial machinery
for the settlement of cases arising within it. The courts of the orders
were presided over by their provincials, generals and commissaries, and
were composed of those dignitaries and other magistrates selected in
accordance with their own rules. Special investigators or visitors were
also delegated to try cases arising within the orders, and to make
inspections, ascertaining the general character of the work of the
orders, the conduct of their dignitaries and the regularity of their
administration.</p>

an example of this we may refer to the work of the Augustinians in
bringing to the light of judicial scrutiny the abuses of certain
<i lang="es">encomenderos</i> against the Indians of Mindanao. This was
in 1581, before the audiencia was established. The offending <i lang=

Salazar, who temporarily deprived them of their holdings and sentenced
them to imprisonment and fines (Governor to the King [day and month not

opposition of Salazar to what he termed the encroachment of the civil
jurisdiction was based on the assumption that the royal patronage did
not extend to tribes which lived in an uncivilized and savage state. He
contended that the pope had not conceded this, consequently, as bishop,
he had entire jurisdiction without interference from the audiencia or
governor over the Mohammedans (as he termed all non-Christians) and the
Chinese (A. I., 1&ndash;1&ndash;3/25).</p>

Fajardo to Felipe III, August 15, 1620, Blair and Robertson, XIX, 155.
The pendulum seems, however, to have swung in the other direction at
times. In 1604, the audiencia was charged with having tried members of
religious orders <i lang="la">in absentia</i> without giving them a
chance to summon witnesses or otherwise to defend themselves (King to
Audiencia, October 30, 1604, A. I., 105&ndash;2&ndash;1). That the
audiencia did not always have power to discipline the friars for
infractions of the royal laws in 1626, is attested by the case of an
Augustinian who led an assault on an <i lang="es">alcalde mayor</i> in
Batangas, destroyed his house, maltreated his person, and, in the
presence of the natives, publicly accomplished his disgrace. The king
demanded from the audiencia a statement of all the facts of the case so
that he and the Council might take proper steps for the punishment of
the offending religious and the protection of His Majesty&rsquo;s
servants in the future (King to Audiencia, May 21, 1623, A. I.,
105&ndash;2&ndash;1). The audiencia conducted an investigation and
forwarded the papers relative to the case to the court for final
action. See Chapter X, note 35.</p>

Inquisition, as represented by one commissary and three alternates (who
were usually bishops) was established in the Philippines on March 1,
1583. The commissary of the Inquisition had for his special field all
questions of faith and heresy, clearing away the errors and
superstitions against the dogma and the lax opinions which pervert
Christian morals (P&eacute;rez y L&oacute;pez, <i lang="es">Teatro</i>,
XXVIII, 208). The Inquisitor of the Philippines was instructed, on his
arrival, to present his papers &ldquo;to the ecclesiastical and lay
chapters in order that they might receive him and recognize him in so
high and holy an office.&rdquo; The Inquisition was represented
continuously in the Philippines until 1813. With the introduction of
this dignitary may be noted the presence in the Philippines of at least
five authorities with ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The ordinary
ecclesiastical tribunals dealt with contentions within the Church. The
papal delegate tried cases which had been appealed from these
ecclesiastical courts. The regular orders had their own particular
tribunals for the rule and discipline of their members and the
audiencia exercised such ecclesiastical jurisdiction as we have noted
in this chapter. There may be slight wonder, therefore, in view of the
presence of so many ecclesiastical tribunals with similar powers, that
there were frequent conflicts of authority.</p>

Audiencia to the King, July 20, 1585, A. I., 67&ndash;6&ndash;18. On
June 26, 1586, the audiencia recommended the discontinuance of the
Inquisition in the Philippines on the ground that it had been utilized
&ldquo;as a citadel for the shelter of those desirous of resisting the
royal authority&rdquo; (Audiencia to the King, A. I.,
68&ndash;1&ndash;33). Archbishop Santiba&ntilde;ez, on the other hand,
was desirous of converting the inquisitorial authority into a tribunal
to consist of two ecclesiastics and one <i lang="es">oidor</i>. He
argued that the distance from Mexico made procedure cumbersome, and it
was manifestly unjust that residents of the Philippines should be
judged by a foreign court (referring to the tribunal in
Mexico.&mdash;Santiba&ntilde;ez to Philip II, June 24, 1598, Blair and
Robertson, X, 151). These same sentiments were expressed sixty years
later by Francisco Bello, procurator at Madrid for the religious
orders. The Council of the Indies returned the petition which had been
submitted by this last-named ecclesiastic, to the Viceroy of New Spain,
and to the Audiencia and Archbishop of Manila, respectively, for their
advice. The consensus of opinion was against the idea of creating a
tribunal in Manila, partially on account of the expense. It was also
shown that such a reform would have meant a loss of power to the
viceroyalty of New Spain, and by the adoption of such a suggestion
there would be created a powerful tribunal which would seriously
inconvenience the authority and supremacy of the audiencia and the
archbishop at Manila (<i lang="es">Consulta</i> of the Council of the
Indies, March 15, 1659, A. I., 67&ndash;6&ndash;22).</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

the Philippines, archbishops were frequently able to combine the
functions and offices of metropolitan prelate and commissary of the
Inquisition. This gave greater pre-eminence to the archbishop and made
the situation more difficult for the civil authorities. We have already
noted an illustration of this in the case of Archbishop Pardo
(1683&ndash;1689). Being also commissary of the Inquisition, he refused
to grant absolution to ex-Governor Vargas, claiming that his authority
as sole inquisitor was not sufficient to justify such action on his
part without first receiving advice from the tribunal in Mexico.</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15985" href="#xd21e15985src" name="xd21e15985">61</a></span> Lea,
in his well-known work on <i>The inquisition in the Spanish
dependencies</i> says that &ldquo;while this branch of the Inquisition
(referring to that in the Philippines) accomplished so little for the
faith, it was eminently successful in the function of contributing to
the disorder and confusion which so disastrously affected Spanish
colonial administration&rdquo; (p. 308). For a more detailed account of
this episode see Cunningham, &ldquo;The inquisition in the Philippines:
the Salcedo affair,&rdquo; in <i>The Catholic historical review</i>,
III, 417&ndash;445.</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15999" href="#xd21e15999src" name="xd21e15999">62</a></span> The
leading church historians of the Philippines&mdash;Mart&iacute;nez de
Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, Salazar, Fonseca and Concepci&oacute;n&mdash;were
naturally unfavorable to Salcedo in their accounts of the events of his
administration. All agree, however, that Salcedo was a man of energy
and precision, who, at the beginning of his rule, gave promise of
universal satisfaction. The correspondence of the civil officials who
were contemporaneous with the governor, and the letters of Salcedo
himself show that his chief concern was the enforcement of the laws and
the elimination of the ecclesiastical and commercial graft with which
the administration of the government of the Philippines was permeated
on his arrival in the Islands (Letters of Coloma, B&oacute;nifaz,
Montemayor, Le&oacute;n, and the Municipal Cabildo, 1670&ndash;1, A.
I., 67&ndash;6&ndash;3; see also note to Ventura del Arco Mss., in
Blair and Robertson, XXXVII, 262).</p>
<p class="footnote">Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, however, states that
Salcedo&rsquo;s commercial reforms were only intended for the benefit
of himself and his friends, and that he reserved the chief articles of
trade for himself, leaving only second-rate and spoiled goods for the
merchants. This same historian states that the governor arranged for
the early departure of the galleon on one occasion, with his goods on
board, leaving those of the majority of the merchants unshipped
(Mart&iacute;nez de Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, <i>An historical view</i>, I,
307&ndash;308). Fonseca charges him with avarice, maintaining that all
classes of society in Manila were disgusted with the governor&rsquo;s
commercial transactions and were shocked at his exile of the
archbishop. This historian relates that &ldquo;the magistracy, the
army, the merchants, arts and industries, ... all raised their voices
against the badly directed government of Salcedo, determining to
over-turn him; representative citizens of Manila petitioned the
audiencia, asking that it deprive him of the government, ... and the
royal <i lang="es">acuerdo</i> determined to do so, but at the last
moment the judges disagreed over the question of whose signature should
precede the others; this question remained in litigation, and blocked
the action of the royal <i lang="es">acuerdo</i>&rdquo; (Fonseca,
<i lang="es">Historia de la provincia de santissimo Rosario</i>. Libro
V, Cap&iacute;tulo VIII, quoted in <i lang="es">Sobre una rese&ntilde;a
hist&oacute;rica</i>, 92). Concepci&oacute;n, the Augustinian
historian, confirms the above, and gives a more clarifying reason for
the failure of the audiencia to oust the governor&mdash;namely, that
the latter was sharing his commercial profits with the magistrates,
thereby purchasing their favors; the <i lang="es">oidores</i> were
therefore reluctant to take action against the governor
(Concepci&oacute;n, <i lang="es">Historia general</i>, VII,
137&ndash;138, 162&ndash;200).</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

Salcedo was charged with plotting to sell the Islands to the Dutch and
with surrounding himself with Flemings, one of whom was a Calvinist. It
was alleged that he had already sent large sums of money to Macao,
including a large part of the funds in the Manila treasury, and that he
was preparing to depart in person. It was said moreover that he
intended to return in command of a Dutch squadron and capture the
colony for Holland. It is evident that there was no lack of charges
against Salcedo (The original correspondence and <i lang=
"es">consultas</i> of the various tribunals which considered the
charges against Salcedo may be noted in A. I., 67&ndash;6&ndash;3. See
Blair and Robertson, XXXVII, 37&ndash;60, Lea, <i>The inquisition in
the Spanish dependencies</i>, 299&ndash;318, and the ecclesiastical
authorities mentioned in the preceding note).</p>
<p class="footnote">Dr. Pardo de Tavera, in his account of the arrest
of Governor Salcedo, says that &ldquo;in 1668, Governor Salcedo had
some difference with (the friars) ... and the archbishop and as a
result, the latter decided to avenge themselves, plotting with the
military officials, <i lang="es">regidores</i> and merchants to bring
him before the Inquisition. They made a conspiracy and, one night while
the governor slept, the conspirators, among whom were the provincial of
the Franciscans, the <i lang="es">guardi&aacute;n</i> of the convent of
that order in Manila, and various other ecclesiastics, entered his
room, surprising him while he slept, and placed him in irons. He was
thus taken to the convent of the Franciscans, but considering the
latter insecure, they carried him to that of San August&iacute;n,
loading him with a heavy chain&rdquo; (Pardo de Tavera, <i lang=
"es">Rese&ntilde;a Hist&oacute;rica</i>, 37). After a period of
imprisonment in Manila, Salcedo was ordered to Mexico for trial by the
tribunal of the Inquisition, as the local authority was without
authority to take further action in the matter. Salcedo never reached
his destination, however, as he died at sea. This was subsequently the
fate of Paternina, the inquisitor who was responsible for his
disgrace.</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16053" href="#xd21e16053src" name="xd21e16053">64</a></span> That
Governor Le&oacute;n had a trying position to fill may be believed by
his description of affairs as he found them in Manila, and of his
struggles to restore the royal authority to its proper status. He gave
a full account of &ldquo;the excessive presumption of the commissary of
the Inquisition in the arrest of Don Diego Salcedo, my (his)
predecessor, and his interference in matters wherein he had no real
jurisdiction.&rdquo; Le&oacute;n reported having prevailed upon the
royal audiencia to order the commissary to refrain from meddling in
affairs which did not concern the Inquisition. The ways of the
Inquisition he described as &ldquo;dark and secret;&rdquo; it was
&ldquo;a danger and a fearful power,&rdquo; a &ldquo;monster, feared by
all,&rdquo; working, not in the light of day, but insidiously,
constituting a sinister power whose strength was not fully realized
(Le&oacute;n to Council, June 10, 1671, and July 4, 1672; <i lang=

While the Salcedo affair accurately depicts the power which the
Inquisition assumed on a particular occasion, the episode cannot be
said to illustrate its power and influence throughout the history of
the Islands. Indeed, never on any former or subsequent occasion did the
Inquisition constitute such a menace to the state. It was generally
prevented from exercising too much power in the Philippines by its own
isolation. Represented by a single agent, who was not always on good
terms with the other ecclesiastical authorities there, and who was
thousands of miles from his immediate superior, the tribunal of Mexico,
he was confronted and opposed by the combined civil, secular and
monastic powers. Owing to these circumstances, the commissary of the
Inquisition in the Philippines could not, single-handed and unaided,
constitute a long-continued danger to the commonwealth.</p>

<i>Ibid.</i>, note 1. This tendency culminated in the decree of
February 22, 1813, which suppressed the Supreme Tribunal of the
Inquisition and renewed the jurisdiction of bishops and vicars over
cases involving the faith, as had been the practice before the
Inquisition was instituted. All property belonging to the Inquisition
reverted to the crown. Soon after the restoration of Ferdinand VII the
Inquisition was revived, against the will of that monarch, it is said,
but it was again abolished by the decrees of March 9, 1820, and July 1,
1835.</p>
<p class="footnote">As a result of the suppression of the Tribunal of
the Inquisition on March 9, 1820, and the transfer of its authority
over matters of faith to the vicars and bishops, Escriche says that
&ldquo;in the exercise of their jurisdiction some of these prelates
exceeded their authority and established in their respective dioceses
<i lang="es">juntas de f&eacute;</i>, which turned out to be in reality
inquisitorial tribunals with practically the same authority which
former tribunals had exercised. They inflicted corporal and spiritual
punishments and guarded in their ministry the most inviolable
secrecy.&rdquo; As soon as reports of this unexpected assumption of
authority came to the notice of the government, Ferdinand hastened to
order the suppression of these self-constituted tribunals, without
immediate success, however. Escriche tells us that they continued their
excesses for some time, &ldquo;depriving accused persons of the means
of defense, keeping from them the names of persons testifying against
them,&rdquo; flagrantly disregarding the dispositions of the brief of
Pius VII, dated October 5, 1829, in prohibition of exactly these
abuses. On February 6, 1830, a <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i> was
expedited which authorized appeals in cases of this nature until three
conforming decisions were rendered. The decree of July 1, 1835,
abolished these tribunals, ordering the prelates to exercise
jurisdiction with appeal to the Department of Grace and Justice
(Escriche, <i lang="es">Diccionario</i>, I, 773).</p>

friar lands litigation began in 1687 and continued until 1751. The
efforts of the government met with considerable opposition. The
<i lang="es">oidores</i> who were charged with the inspection of the
titles to these lands frequently abandoned their commissions and
recommended that the friars be left alone. However, in the year last
mentioned, the opposition of the Franciscans, the last of the resisting
orders, was overcome (Correspondence regarding friar lands exists in A.
I., 68&ndash;4&ndash;12 and 68&ndash;6&ndash;26). See also the Camacho

&ldquo;In America [and in the Philippines] the monks were given a
somewhat unusual position. According to the canon law they were not
able to hold beneficed curacies, but the extent of the American field,
and the limited number of the clergy available to occupy it, induced
Leo X, Adrian VI, Paul III, Clement VIII, and Pius V to permit them to
become parish priests. Under this order a very large number of these
parishes in America in the first century were occupied by friars. But
in the middle of the eighteenth century, this privilege was withdrawn,
leaving them only two friars in a conventual province&rdquo; (Moses,
<i>South America on the eve of emancipation</i>, 138&ndash;139).</p>

legajo list was obtained from the index of the collection of
manuscripts in the section known as <i lang="es">Audiencia de
Filipinas</i>, of the Archive of the Indies in Seville. The aim is only

The above system of reference to documents in the Archive of the Indies
is used universally, and it has been employed consistently in this
treatise. The manuscripts are wrapped and tied in bundles (<i lang=
"es">legajos</i>), which, in turn, are to be found in large cases
(<i lang="es">estantes</i>), and the shelves (<i lang="es">cajones</i>)
of the cases are numbered. The meaning of the above reference therefore
is <i lang="es">Estante 68</i>, <i lang="es">Caj&oacute;n 6</i>,
<i lang="es">Legajo 3</i>, indicating that <i lang="es">legajo</i>
number 3 is to be found on Shelf 6 of Case 68 of the Archive. A
<i lang="es">legajo</i> contains in the neighborhood of 2,000 pages of
hand-written manuscript. The documents may be originals, certified
copies or ordinary drafts or duplicates. They are supposed to be
grouped according to subject-matter, and usually the materials in a
given <i lang="es">caj&oacute;n</i> deal with a phase of the same
question. <i lang="es">Legajos</i> in a given <i lang=
"es">caj&oacute;n</i> and manuscripts in a given <i lang=
"es">legajo</i>, roughly speaking, are arranged chronologically, though
in many cases they have lost their original order owing to careless
handling. This description is sufficient to identify any document to
which this classification is applied, as these numbers are not
duplicated, though often the documents are, and copies of the same
manuscript may be found in different <i lang="es">cajones</i>.</p>
